  <h2 class='c003'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>The inducement to write this book was to
supply, in a slight measure, the want of any
particular history of British rule in West
Florida. With that inducement, however, the
effort would not have been made but for the
sources of original information existing in the
Archives of the Dominion of Canada, as well as
others, pointed out to me by Dr. William
Kingsford of Ottawa, author of the ‘History
of Canada;’ to whom I take this occasion of
making my acknowledgments.</p>

<p class='c005'>An account of British rule necessitated one of
Spanish colonial annals, both before and after it.</p>

<p class='c005'>If any apology be necessary for the space
devoted to the Creeks, it will be found in the
considerations that for twenty years the body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of the nation was within the limits of British
West Florida; that their relations with the
British, formed during that period, influenced
their conduct towards the United States until
after the War of 1812; and above all, that the
life of Alexander McGillivray forms a part of
the history of West Florida, both under British
and Spanish rule.</p>

<p class='c005'>The prominence given to Pensacola is due to
its having been the capital of both British and
Spanish West Florida, and therefore the centre
of provincial influence.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Discovery of Pensacola Bay by Panfilo de Narvaez—The
Visits of Maldonado, Captain of the Fleet of
Hernando de Soto.</p>

<p class='c012'>On one of the early days of October, 1528,
there could have been seen, coasting westward
along and afterwards landing on the south
shore of Santa Rosa Island, five small, rudely-constructed
vessels, having for sails a grotesque
patchwork of masculine under and over-wear.
That fleet was the fruit of the first effort at
naval construction within the present limits of
the United States. It was built of yellow pine
and caulked with palmetto fibre and pitch.
Horses’ tails and manes furnished the cordage,
as did their hides its water vessels. Its freightage
consisted of two hundred and forty human
bodies, wasted and worn by fatigue and exposure,
and as many hearts heavy and racked
with disappointment. It was commanded by His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Excellency Panfilo de Narvaez, Captain-general
and Adelantado of Florida, a tall, big-limbed,
red-haired, one-eyed man, “with a voice deep
and sonorous as though it came from a cavern.”</p>

<p class='c013'>These were the first white men to make footprints
on the shores of Pensacola Bay and to
look out upon its waters. Although they landed
on the Island, there is no evidence that their
vessels entered the harbor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Narvaez, an Hidalgo, born at Valladolid about
1480, was a man capable of conceiving and
undertaking great enterprises, but too rash and
ill-starred for their successful execution, possessing
the ambition and avarice which impelled the
Spanish adventurers to the shores of the Gulf
of Mexico during the <a id='e1'></a>sixteenth century, with
whom Indian life was but a trifling sacrifice for
a pearl or an ounce of gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>Five years before his Florida expedition he
had been appointed, with a large naval and
land force under his command, by Velasquez,
governor of Cuba, to supersede Cortez, the
conqueror of Mexico, and to send him in chains
to Havana, to answer charges of insubordination
to the authority of Velasquez. But Cortez
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>was not the man to be thus superseded. Never
did his genius for great enterprises make a more
striking display than by the measures he adopted
and executed in this emergency. By them he
converted that threatening expedition into one
of succor for himself, embracing every supply,
soldiers included, he required to complete his
conquests. Of this great achievement the defeat
of the incompetent Narvaez was only an
incident.</p>

<p class='c013'>No labored comparison of conqueror and
vanquished could present a more striking contrast
between them than that suggested by
their first interview. “Esteem it,” said Narvaez,
“great good fortune that you have taken me
captive.” “It is the least of the things I have
done in Mexico,” replied Cortez, a sarcasm
aimed at the incapacity of Narvaez, apart from
the gains of the victor.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fruits of the expedition to Narvaez were
the loss of his left eye, shackles, imprisonment,
banishment, and the humiliation of kneeling to
his conqueror and attempting to kiss his hand.
To the Aztec the result was the introduction of
a scourge that no surrender could placate, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>submission, however absolute and abject, could
stay, and, therefore, more pitiless than the
sword of Cortez—the small-pox.</p>

<p class='c013'>After leaving Mexico, Narvaez appeared before
the Emperor Charles V., to accuse Cortez of
treason, and to petition for a redress of his own
wrongs, but the dazzling success of Cortez, to
say nothing of his large remittances to the
royal treasury, was an effectual answer to every
charge. The emperor, however, healed the
wounded pride, and silenced the complaints of
the prosecutor by a commission with the aforementioned
sonorous titles to organize an expedition
for a new conquest, by which he might
compensate himself for the loss of the treasures
and empire of Montezuma, which he had so
disastrously failed to snatch from the iron
grasp of Cortez.</p>

<p class='c013'>The preparations to execute this commission
having been made by providing a fleet, a land
force, consisting of men-at-arms and cavalry,
as well as the necessary supplies, Narvaez, in
April, 1528, sailed for the Florida coast, and
landed at or near Tampa bay.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having resolved on a westward movement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>he ordered his fleet to sail along the coast,
whilst he, by rather a circuitous march, would
advance in the same direction. This parting
was at once final and fatal. He again reached
the Gulf, somewhere in the neighborhood of St.
Marks, with his command woefully wasted and
diminished by toil, battle and disease; and, as
can well be imagined, with his dreams of avarice
and dominion rudely dispelled.</p>

<p class='c013'>No tidings of the fleet from which he had so
lucklessly parted being obtainable, despair improvised
that fleet with motley sails which we
have seen mooring off the island of Santa Rosa
in the early days of October, its destination
being Mexico—a destination, however, which
was but another delusion that the winds and
the waves were to dispel.</p>

<p class='c013'>Narvaez found a grave in the maw of the sea,
as did most of the remnant of his followers.
Famine swept off others, leaving only four to
reach Mexico after a land journey requiring
years, marked by perils and sufferings incident
to such a journey through a vast forest bounded
only by the sea, intersected by great rivers, inhabited
by savages, and infested by wild beasts.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>One of the survivors was Cabeça de Vaca, the
treasurer and historian of the expedition.</p>

<p class='c013'>Twelve years elapsed after Narvaez discovered
Pensacola Bay before the shadow of the white
man’s sail again fell upon its waters. In
January, 1540, Capitano Maldonado, who was
the commander of the fleet which brought
Fernando de Soto to the Florida coast, entered
the harbor, gave it a careful examination, and
bestowed upon it the name of Puerta d’ Anchusi,
a name probably suggested by Ochus,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> which it
bore at the time of his visit. In entering Ochus
he ended a voyage westward, made in search of
a good harbor, under the orders of Soto, who
was at that time somewhere on the Florida
coast to the westward of Apalachee.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having returned to Soto, Maldonado made
so favorable a report—the first official report—of
the advantages of Puerta d’ Anchusi that
Soto determined to make it his base of supply.
He accordingly ordered Maldonado to proceed
to Havana, and after having procured the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>required succors to sail to Puerta d’ Anchusi,
where he intended to go himself, and there to
await Maldonado’s return before he ventured
into the interior; a prudent resolve, suggested
possibly by the sight of the bones of Narvaez’s
horses, which had been slain to furnish cordage
and water-vessels for his fleet.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the resolve was as brief as it was wise. A
few days after Maldonado’s departure a captured
Indian so beguiled Soto with tales of gold
to be found far to the northeast of Apalachee,
where he then was, that banishing all thoughts
of Puerta d’ Anchusi from his mind, he began
that circuitous march which carried him into
South Carolina, northern Georgia, and Alabama,
where he wandered in search of treasure until
disappointment, wasted forces, and needed supplies
again turned his march southward, and his
thoughts to his rendezvous with Maldonado.</p>

<p class='c013'>That rendezvous was to be in October, 1540.
Faithful to instructions, Maldonado was at
Puerta d’ Anchusi at the appointed time with a
fleet bearing all the required supplies. But Soto
did not keep the tryst. He was then at Mauvilla,
or Maubila, supposed to be Choctaw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Bluff, on the Alabama river, absorbed by difficulties
and engaged in conflicts such as he had
never before encountered. Through Indians
they had communicated, and intense was the
satisfaction of Soto and his command at the
prospect of a relief of their wants, repose from
their toils, and tidings of their friends and loved
ones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Soto, however, still ambitious of emulating
the achievements of Cortez and Pizzaro, looked
upon Puerta d’ Anchusi as only a base of supply
and refuge for temporary repose, from
which again to set out in search of his goal.
But very different were the views of his followers.
By eaves-dropping on a dark night behind
their tents, he learned that to them Puerta d’
Anchusi was not to be a haven of temporary
rest only, but the first stage of their journey
homeward, where Soto and his fortunes were
to be abandoned.</p>

<p class='c013'>This information again banished Puerta d’
Anchusi from his thoughts under the promptings
of pride, which impelled him to prefer death
in the wilderness to the mockery and humiliation
of failure. He at once resolved to march
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>deeper into the heart of the continent, and, unconsciously,
nearer to the mighty river in whose
cold bosom he was to find a grave.</p>

<p class='c013'>As in idea we go into the camp at Mauvilla,
on the morning when the word of command
was given for a westward march, we see depicted
on the war-worn visages of that iron band
naught but gloom and disappointment, as, constrained
by the stern will of one man, they
obediently fall into ranks without a murmur,
much less a sign of revolt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again, if in fancy we stand on the deck of
Maldonado’s ship at Puerta d’ Anchusi, we
may realize the keen watchfulness and the deep
anxiety with which day after day and night
after night he scans the shore and hills beyond
to catch a glint of spear or shield, or strains his
ear to hear a bugle note announcing the
approach of his brothers-in-arms. And only
after long, weary months was the vigil ended,
as he weighed anchor and sailed out of the
harbor to go to other points on the Gulf
shore where happily he might yet meet and
succor his commander.</p>

<p class='c013'>To this task did he devote himself for three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>years, scouring the Gulf coast from Florida to
Vera Cruz, until the curtain of the drama was
lifted for him, to find that seventeen months
previously his long-sought chief had been lying
in the depths of the Mississippi, and that a
wretched remnant only of that proud host,
which he had last seen in glittering armor on
the coast of Florida, had reached Mexico after
undergoing indescribable perils and privations.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The Settlement of Don Tristram de Luna at Santa Maria—His
Explorations—Abandonment of the Settlement—The
First Pensacola.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nearly twenty years passed away after
Maldonado’s visit to Ochus before Europeans
again looked upon its shores.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1556, the viceroy of Mexico, and the bishop
of Cuba united in a memorial to the Emperor
Charles V. representing Florida as an inviting
field for conquest and religious work. Imperial
sanction having been secured, an expedition
was organized under the command of
Don Tristram de Luna to effect the triple objects
of bringing gold into the emperor’s treasury,
extending his dominions, and enlarging the
bounds of the spiritual kingdom by winning
souls to the church. For the first two enterprises
one thousand five hundred soldiers were
provided, and for the last a host of ecclesiastics,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>friars, and other spiritual teachers. Puerta d’
Anchusi was selected as the place of the projected
settlement, the base from which the cross and
the sword were to advance to their respective
conquests.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly, on the fourteenth day of August,
1559, de Luna’s fleet cast anchor within the
harbor, which he named Santa Maria; the same
year in which the monarch who authorized the
expedition died, the month, and nearly the day
on which he, a living man, was engaged in the
paradoxical farce of participating in his own
funeral ceremonies in the monastery of Yusté.</p>

<p class='c013'>The population of two thousand souls, which
the fleet brought, with the required supplies of
every kind, having been landed, the work of
settlement began. Of the place where the settlement
was made there exists no historic information,
and we are left to the inference that the
local advantages which afterwards induced d’
Arriola to select what is now called Barrancas
as the site of his town, governed the selection of
de Luna’s, unless tradition enables us to identify
the spot, as a future page will endeavor to do.</p>

<p class='c013'>The destruction of the fleet by a hurricane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>within a week after its arrival threw a shadow
over the infant settlement, aggravating the
natural discontent incident to all colonizations,
resulting from the contrast between the stern
realities of experience and of expectations colored
by the imagination of the colonist.
Against that discontent, ever on the increase,
de Luna manfully and successfully struggled until
1562; and thus it was, that for two years
and more there existed a town of about two
thousand inhabitants on the shores of Pensacola
Bay, which antedated by four years St.
Augustine, the oldest town of the United States.</p>

<p class='c013'>Don Tristram de Luna sent expeditions into
the interior, and finally led one in person. In
these journeys the priest and the friar joined, and
daily in a tabernacle of tree boughs the holy
offices of the Catholic faith were performed, the
morning chant and the evening hymn breaking
the silence and awakening the echoes of the
primeval forest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Where they actually went, and how far north,
it is impossible to say, owing to our inability
to identify the sites of villages, rivers, and other
land marks mentioned in the narratives of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>journeys. The presumption is strong, however,
that they took, and followed northward the
Indian trail, on the ridge beginning at Pensacola
Bay, forming the water shed between the
Perdido and Escambia rivers, and beyond their
headwaters uniting with the elevated country
which throws off its springs and creeks eastward
to the Chattahoochee and westward to
the Alabama and Tallapoosa rivers. It continued
northerly to the Tennessee river; a lateral
trail diverging to where the city of Montgomery
now stands, and thence to the site of Wetumpka;
and still another leading to what is
now Grey’s Ferry on the Tallapoosa.</p>

<p class='c013'>That trail, according to tradition, was the
one by which the Indians, from the earliest
times, passed between the Coosa country and
the sea, the one followed in later times by the
Indian traders on their pack-ponies, and the
line of march of General Jackson in his invasion
of Florida in 1814.</p>

<p class='c013'>That it was regarded and used as their guiding
thread by de Luna’s expeditions in penetrating
the unknown country north of Santa
Maria they sought to explore, is evidenced by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>two facts. They came to a large river which,
instead of crossing, they followed its course,
undoubtedly by the ridge, and, therefore, not
far from the trail. They also came to or
crossed the line of de Soto’s march, which he
had made ten years previously, as following the
trail they would be compelled to do and found
amongst the Indians a vivid recollection of the
destruction and rapine of their people by white
men, which they assigned as the cause of the
then sparsity of population, and the abandonment
of clearings formerly under cultivation.</p>

<p class='c013'>So impressed was de Luna with the fertility
and other attractive features of the beautiful
region of Central Alabama, which he explored,
that he determined to plant a colony there.
But in that design he was eventually thwarted
by the discontent and insubordination of his followers,
the most of whom, from the first, seem
to have had no other object in view than to
break up the settlement, and to terminate their
insupportable exile by returning to Mexico.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were amongst those composing the
expedition two elements which proved fatal to
its success. The gold-greedy soon found that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the pine barrens of Florida, and the fertile valleys
of Alabama were not the eldorado of which
they had dreamed. To the friar, the spiritual
outlook was not more promising, the Indians
he encountered being more ready to scalp their
would-be spiritual guide than to open their ears
to his teachings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ostensibly, to procure supplies for the colony,
two friars sailed for Havana and thence to
Vera Cruz, to make known its necessities to the
Viceroy of Mexico, and solicit the required succor.
But, as soon as they could reach his ear
they endeavored to persuade him of the futility
of the expedition, and the unpromising character
of the country as a field for colonization.</p>

<p class='c013'>At first, his heart being in the enterprise, he
was loathe to listen to reports so inconsistent
with the glowing accounts which had prompted
the expedition and enlisted his zealous support;
but, at last, an impression was made upon him,
and an inquiry resolved upon.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the viceroyal investigation was forestalled
by the visit to Santa Maria of Don
Angel de Villafana, whom the Viceroy of Cuba
had appointed governor of that, at that time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>undefined region called Florida, who permitted
the dissatisfied colonists to embark in his
vessels, and abandon the, to them, hateful country
in which they had passed two miserable
years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Don Tristram de Luna, with a few followers
only, remained, with the fixed resolution to
maintain the settlement, provided he could
secure the approbation and assistance of the
Viceroy. But an application for that purpose,
accompanied by representations of the inviting
character of the interior for settlement, was
met by a prompt recall of de Luna and an order
for the abandonment of the enterprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Don Tristram, against whom history makes
no accusations of cruelty or bloodshed during
his expeditions into the interior, or his stay at
Santa Maria, and who, animated by the spirit
of legitimate colonization, sought only to found
a new settlement, invites respect, if not admiration,
as a character distinct and apart from the
gold-seeking cut-throat adventurers that Spain
sent in shoals to the Gulf shores during the sixteenth
century. Sympathy with him in his
trials and regret at his failure, induce the reflection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>that, perhaps, had he been burdened with
fewer gold-seekers and only one-twentieth of the
ecclesiastics who encumbered and leavened the
colony with discontent, his settlement might
have proved permanent.</p>

<p class='c013'>The local results of de Luna’s expedition were
fixing, for a time, the name of Santa Maria
upon the Bay, and permanently stamping upon
its shores the name Pensacola; and here narration
must be suspended to determine the origin
of the latter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Roberts says, the name was “that of an Indian
tribe inhabiting round the bay but which
was destroyed.” Mr. Fairbanks tells us it was
“a name derived from the locality having been,
formerly, that of the town of a tribe of Indians
called Pencacolas, which had been entirely
exterminated in conflicts with neighboring
tribes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The first objection to this assigned origin of
the name is, that it is evidently not Indian, such
names in West Florida invariably terminating
with a double e, as for examples, Apalachee,
Choctawhatchee, Uchee, Ochusee, Escambee,
Ochesee, Chattahoochee. The “cola” added to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Apalachee, and “ia” substituted in Escambia
for ee, indicate the difference between the terminations
of Indian and Spanish names.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again, amongst savages, we should expect to
find in the name of a place an indication of a
natural object, the name being expressive of the
object, and hence as lasting. But, that the
accident of an encampment of savages upon a
locality should stamp that locality with their
tribal name, as a designation that should survive
not only the encampment, but the very
existence of the tribe, is incredible. An extinct
tribe would in a generation or two cease to
have a place in the traditions of surviving
tribes, because their extinction would be only
an ordinary event amongst American savages.</p>

<p class='c013'>The termination being Spanish, and no natural
object existing suggestive of the name, we
naturally turn our search to a vocabulary of
Spanish names, historical and geographical.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perched upon a rock springing 240 feet high
from the Mediterranean shore of Spain, connected
with the mainland by a narrow strip of
sand, is the fortified little seaport of Peniscola.
Substitute “a” for “i,” transpose “s” and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>have the name for the original of which we seek.
The seaports of Spain furnished the great body
of Spanish adventurers to America in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries; and what
more likely than that some native of the little
town crowning with its vine-clad cottages the
huge rock that looks out upon the “midland
ocean,” should have sought to honor his home
by fixing its name upon a spot in the new
world?</p>

<p class='c013'>When and by whom the name was affixed to
our shores is an interesting inquiry. Neither
Roberts, nor Fairbanks, nor any other authority,
informs us. It comes into history with the
advent of d’ Arriola, whose settlement will be
the subject of a future page.</p>

<p class='c013'>Three hypotheses furnish as many answers
to the question: it was original with Arriola
to the extent at least of a new application of a
Spanish name; or he found the place already
named in some chart or document now lost to
us; or already fixed by an Indian tradition,
according to Roberts and Fairbanks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first hypothesis requires no comment.
The second rests upon the existence of a fact of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>which we can procure no evidence. The third is
a tradition founded upon, or involving, a Spanish
name.</p>

<p class='c013'>Very extraordinary events or striking objects
only are the subjects of the traditions of savage
tribes; and what event can be imagined more
extraordinary and impressive to the savage
mind than to be brought suddenly in contact,
for the first time, with the white man under all
the circumstances and conditions of de Luna’s
settlement? It was one not likely to pass out
of tradition in the lapse of one hundred and
thirty-three years, for two long lives only
would be required for its transmission. The
settlers would be, in Indian terminology, a tribe;
their departure would be an extinction; and
vanity would at last attribute its ending to the
prowess of the Red man.</p>

<p class='c013'>A name that identifies a locality and forms a
feature of a purely Indian tradition, having no
reference to or connection whatever with the
white man, must be an Indian name. Here,
however, the name under discussion is a Spanish
and not an Indian name. The conclusion
is, therefore, irresistible, that as the name is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Spanish the tradition relates to Spaniards,
and that the former is a Spanish designation of
the locality of the people to whom it relates.</p>

<p class='c013'>The settlement of de Luna was the only Spanish
settlement with which the Indians could
have come in contact before Arriola’s. That
settlement, therefore, must be the subject of the
Indian tradition, and the Spanish name Pensacola
must have been its name.</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Andrés de Pes—Santa Maria de Galva—Don Andres d’
Arriola—The Resuscitation of Pensacola—Its Consequences.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1693, Don Andrés de Pes entered the Bay,
but how long he remained, or why he came,
whether for examination of its advantages, from
curiosity, or necessity, to disturb its solitude
and oblivion of one hundred and thirty-three
years, history does not say. But as a memorial
of his visit, he supplemented the name de Luna
had given it with de Galva, in honor of the
Viceroy of Mexico; and thus, it comes into
colonial history with the long title of Santa
Maria de Galva.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1696, three years after de Pes’ visit, Don
Andrés d’ Arriola, with three hundred soldiers
and settlers, took formal possession of the
harbor and the surrounding country, which, to
make effectual and permanent, he built a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“square fort with bastions” at what is now
called Barrancas, which he named San Carlos.
As the beginning, or rather reconstruction of a
town named Pensacola, he erected some houses
adjacent to the fort. And there, too, was built
a church, historically the first ever erected on
the shores of Pensacola Bay, but presumptively
the second; for it is hardly credible that the
large settlement of de Luna, embracing so many
ecclesiastics, should have failed to observe the
universal custom of the Spaniards to build a
church wherever they planted a colony. Irresistible,
therefore, is the inference that the first
notes of a church-bell heard within the limits of
the United States were those which rolled over
the waters of Pensacola Bay and the white
hills of Santa Rosa from 1559 to 1562.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having demonstrated that the settlement of
de Luna was the original Pensacola, that of
Arriola was apparently the second, though
actually but a resuscitation of the colony of
1559; for the name, the people, though not the
same generation, and the place being one, mere
lapse of time should not be permitted to destroy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the unity which may be so justly attributed to
the two settlements.</p>

<p class='c013'>The inhabitants of the town having been
largely recruited by malefactors banished from
Mexico, must be notched low in the scale of
morals. But, perhaps, in some instances at
least, actions were then adjudged crimes deserving
banishment which might be deemed
virtues in a more enlightened age, and under free
institutions; for under the despotic colonial
governments of Spanish America in that age to
criticize the vices, or censure the lawless edicts
of a satrap, was a heinous offence, for which
transportation was but a mild punishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Originally, Spain’s dominion was asserted
over the entire circle of the shores of the Gulf of
Mexico, as well as over all the islands which
they girdled. But upon the voyage of La Salle
from the upper waters of the Mississippi to the
sea, France asserted a claim, under the name of
Louisiana, to the entire valley of the river from
its spring-heads to the Gulf, making to the extent
of the southern limit of her claim, from
east to west, a huge gap in Spain’s North
American empire.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>But where were the eastern boundary of
Louisiana, and the western limit of Florida to
be fixed? Had the French expedition under
Iberville reached Florida before Arriola’s, Pensacola
would have been included in Louisiana,
and afterwards in the State of Alabama. But
Arriola’s settlement was first, in point of time;
and it is to him must be attributed the establishment
of the Perdido as the boundary line
between the French and Spanish colonies, and
the consequent exclusion of Pensacola from the
limits of the great State of Alabama, her political
influence, her fostering care, and, comparatively,
from the vitalizing influence of her vast
mineral and agricultural resources.</p>

<p class='c013'>The interest of history consists not in the
mere knowledge or contemplation of events as
isolated facts, but in studying their interrelations,
and following their threads of connection
through all the meshes of cause and
effect. It is, therefore, an interesting reflection
that the settlement of Arriola may not have
been the absolute, though it was the apparent,
cause of the consequences above pointed out.
Behind it, in the shadow of a century and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>third, may perchance be discerned the ultimate
and final cause of those consequences in the
settlement of de Luna. He planted the first
colony, and because he so did, Arriola settled
his on that spot upon which the lost chart and
tradition probably coincided in fixing the Pensacola
of 1559.</p>

<p class='c013'>How illustrative of the truth that as one
human life can have but one beginning, so it is
with that aggregate of human lives which we
call a people. “In the almighty hands of
eternal God, a people’s history is interrupted
and recommenced—never.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Iberville’s Expedition—Settlement at Biloxi and Mobile—Amicable
Relations of the French and Spanish Colonies
from 1700-1719.</p>

<p class='c012'>The French expedition referred to in the
previous chapter, the delay of which was so
fateful to the growth and commercial future of
Pensacola, appeared off the mouth of the harbor
in January, 1699. But, observing the
Spanish flag flying from the mast-head of two
war vessels lying in the Bay and from the flagstaff
of Fort San Carlos, they did not enter the
harbor, but cast anchor off the Island of Santa
Rosa. Thence an application was made to the
Spanish governor for permission to enter, which
was promptly refused.</p>

<p class='c013'>After that curt refusal of the Spaniards, the
fleet, consisting of three vessels under the
command of Lemoine d’ Iberville, accompanied
by his brothers, Bienvielle and Sauville,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>which was taking out a colony with the necessary
supplies to settle southern Louisiana,
sailed westward and took formal possession of
the country west of the Perdido river.</p>

<p class='c013'>Iberville’s first settlement was made at Biloxi
on the twenty-seventh of February, 1699, but
it was afterwards abandoned, in 1702, and removed
to Mobile.</p>

<p class='c013'>To the accession of Philip V., a Bourbon
prince, to the Spanish crown, whilst Louis XIV.
reigned in France, must be attributed the
strangely peaceful settlement of the Perdido as
the boundary line between Louisiana and
Florida. For the politic, if not natural, harmony
existing between two kings belonging to the
same royal family, a grandfather and a grandson,
both the objects of jealousy and suspicion
to the other nations of Europe, necessarily inspired
a like feeling in their respective colonial
officers. Hence it was that we find that the
ineffectual expedition of Governor Ravolli of
Pensacola, in 1700, to expel the French from
Ship Island, was the last instance of hostility
between the Louisiana French and the Florida
Spaniards for a period of nineteen years.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Indeed, so intimate were the relations between
the two colonies, that Iberville, coming from
France, in 1702, with two war ships taking
succor to the French colonists, terminated their
voyage at Pensacola, and thence sent the supplies
to Mobile in small vessels. Again, in
1703, he began a voyage to France by sailing
from Pensacola.</p>

<p class='c013'>The War of the Spanish Succession, in which
England was the antagonist of Spain and
France, tightened the bonds of amity between
the colonies of the latter. In 1702, in anticipation
of an English expedition against Pensacola,
Governor Martino readily procured from
Bienville a needed supply of arms and ammunition.
On the other hand, in 1704, Governor
Martino promptly furnished food from his
stores at Pensacola to the famine-threatened
colonists at Mobile; that kind office being a
just requital of a like humanity which had
been exercised by Bienville, in 1702, towards
the starving garrison of San Carlos.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1706-7, eighteen Englishmen from Carolina,
heading a large body of Indians, made
inroads upon the Spanish settlements in Florida,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and, strange as it may seem, extended their
operations as far westward as Pensacola. In
the latter year, Bienville was applied to by the
Spanish governor to aid him in defending Pensacola
from an impending attack by the Englishmen
and their Indian allies. Prompt and bold
in action, Bienville at once advanced from
Mobile with one hundred and twenty Canadians
to assist the Spaniards. But no conflict occurred,
for after a few days of hostile demonstrations
the enemy abandoned their enterprise,
owing to the want of necessary supplies.</p>

<p class='c013'>In other ways, too, the good feeling and intimate
relations of the two colonies were manifested.
We learn, from a letter of the mean,
jealous, and growling Governor Condillac of
Louisiana to Count Pontchartrain, that, in
1713, there existed a trade between Pensacola
and Mobile, in which the former was supplied
by the latter with lumber, poultry and vegetables—a
petty traffic, but not too small to excite
the jealousy of the old grumbler.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such were the friendly relations existing
between the Florida Spaniards and the Louisiana
French up to 1719, being the year after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Bienville had founded the city of New Orleans;
relations which must be borne in mind to enable
us to form an enlightened judgment upon the
actions of the men engaged in the bloody
drama which was ushered in by the nineteen
years of kind offices and good fellowship which
have been mentioned.</p>

<hr class='c015' />
<p class='c016'>Lemoine d’ Iberville, a Canadian, esteemed the most
skillful officer of the French navy brilliantly distinguished
on many occasions, was selected to command the expedition
to southern Louisiana, designed to perfect by colonization
the claim France founded upon the voyage of La Salle. He
and his brothers, Bienville, the founder of New Orleans,
Sauville, Sevigny and Chateaugné presented a group of
men seldom accorded to one family.</p>

<p class='c016'>During a visit to Havana, d’ Iberville died on the ninth
of July, 1706, leaving to his brothers the task of perfecting
the great enterprise to which the last seven years of his own
life had been devoted.</p>

<p class='c011'>War Declared by France against Spain—Bienville Surprises
Metamoras—Metamoras Surprises Chateaugné—Bienville
Attacks and Captures Pensacola—San Carlos and
Pensacola Destroyed—Magazine Spared.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the thirteenth of April, 1719, two French
vessels brought to the French colony the intelligence
that in the previous December, France had
declared war against Spain; an event of which
Don Juan Pedro Metamoras, governor of
Pensacola, who had just succeeded Don Gregorio
de Salinas, had no information.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bienville at once organized, with all possible
secrecy, an expedition by land and water to
capture Pensacola by surprise. The land force,
consisting of four hundred Indians and a body
of Canadians, was collected at Mobile. The
naval force, composed of three vessels, two of
them, the <i>Philippe</i> and the <i>Toulouse</i>, carrying
twenty-four guns each, under the command of
Sevigny, had its rendezvous at Dauphin Island.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The movement of Bienville, who marched
across the country with his land force, and that
of the fleet were so well timed that on the
fourteenth of May, at 5 o’clock in the afternoon,
as the vessels presented their shotted broadsides
to San Carlos, Bienville, his Canadians, and
Indians, appeared on its land side. There was,
of course, nothing for Metamoras to do but to
order the chamade to be beaten and to settle
the terms of capitulation. He surrendered the
post and all public property within his jurisdiction.
It was stipulated that he and his garrison
should march out of the fort with the honors of
war, retaining a cannon and three charges of
powder, that they should be transported to
Havana in French vessels, that the town should
be protected from violence, and that the property
of the soldiers and that of the inhabitants
should be respected.</p>

<p class='c013'>The victim of such a ruse, it was natural that
Metamoras should have directed his thoughts
to retaliation; and it is probable that during the
voyage to Havana he meditated for his captors
a surprise as complete and prompt as that
which he had just suffered from them.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>After the French vessels, the <i>Toulouse</i> and the
<i>Mareschal de Villars</i> had reached Cuba and
landed their prisoners, they were seized by order
of the governor of Havana, who had at once,
upon learning of the disaster at Pensacola,
determined upon its prompt reparation by a
recapture. He accordingly prepared a fleet, consisting
of a Spanish war ship, nine brigantines
and the two French vessels. In this fleet
Metamoras and his lately captured troops,
besides others, embarked for Pensacola.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the sixth of August, the Spanish fleet was
off the harbor. The two French vessels, flying
the French flag, first entered as decoys, to
enable them to secure favorable positions for
attacking San Carlos in the event of a refusal
to surrender. Immediately after them came the
Spanish war vessel. The ruse for position succeeded,
but the demand to surrender was
peremptorily refused by Chateaugné, the commander
of the fort. To an almost harmless
cannonade there succeeded an armistice, which
the French sought to have extended to four, but
which the Spaniards limited to two days.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the expiration of the armistice, another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>ineffectual exchange of cannon shots was followed
by the surrender of the fort; the terms
being that the garrison of one hundred and
sixty men should march out with the honors of
war and be sent to Havana as prisoners.
Chateaugné also was to be sent there and
thence to Spain to await exchange. They were
accordingly all taken to Havana. Chateaugné,
however, instead of being sent from there to
Spain, was imprisoned in Moro Castle, where
he remained only a short time, in consequence
of the energetic preparations which his brother,
Bienville, was then making for his deliverance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Metamoras, once again in command at Pensacola,
fully realized that the stake for which he
and Bienville had been playing was not to be
finally won by such strategems, as each in turn
had been the other’s victim, and that the two
which had been achieved were but preludes to
a trial by battle. Appreciating, too, the
bold, prompt and enterprising Bienville, he well
calculated that his time for preparation would
be short, and he accordingly improved it to the
best of his abilities and resources.</p>

<p class='c013'>He erected a battery on Point Seguenza, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>western extremity of Santa Rosa Island, which
he named Principe d’ Asturias, to aid San
Carlos and the Spanish fleet in resisting an
attack by sea. To guard San Carlos from a
land attack, he built a stockade in its rear. To
man all his works he had a force of six hundred
men.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Fort was captured by Metamoras early
in August, and on the eighteenth of the following
September Bienville was ready to settle by
arms his right to retain it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The celerity of Bienville’s preparations was
due, however, to the accidental arrival at
Dauphin Island of a French fleet under Champmeslin,
who at once relieved him from the care
and preparation of the seaward operations
of his expedition.</p>

<p class='c013'>The naval force of the French consisted of six
vessels, under the command of Champmeslin,
the <i>Hercules</i> of sixty-four guns, the <i>Mars</i> of sixty,
the <i>Triton</i> of fifty, the <i>Union</i> of thirty-six, the
---- of thirty-six and the <i>Philippe</i> of twenty. The
land force, commanded by Bienville in person,
consisted of two hundred and fifty troops lately
arrived from France, besides a large number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Canadian volunteers, which, when it reached
Perdido, was joined by five hundred Indians
under Longueville.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whilst Bienville was moving towards Pensacola,
Champmeslin, having sailed from Dauphin
Island, entered the harbor on the eighteenth of
September with five of his vessels, and was
soon engaged in a fierce conflict with Principe
d’ Asturias, the Spanish fleet, and San Carlos.
At the time the five vessels went into action, it
was supposed that the <i>Hercules</i> was following
them, but her commander hesitated to cross the
bar, owing to her draught of twenty-one feet, a
hesitation which almost proved fatal to her
consorts, for, relying upon the support of her
heavy batteries, they now found themselves
without it, whilst they were under the concentrated
fire of the Spanish fleet and the two forts.</p>

<p class='c013'>In that conjuncture, however, they were saved
by one of those inspirations which sometimes
come to a man in the supreme hour of trial,
making him for the occasion the soul of a host.
A Canadian pilot, being inspired himself, inspired
the commander of the <i>Hercules</i> with confidence
in his ability to take her over the bar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and into the action. With a cheer from her crew
and all the canvas she could bear, the gallant
ship sped under the guidance of the bold Canadian
to the rescue of her consorts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Speedily her sixty-four guns turned the tide of
battle. Whilst her heavy broadside of thirty-two
guns soon battered Principe d’ Asturias
into silence, her consorts poured their fire into
the Spanish fleet, which, now short of powder,
struck its colors.</p>

<p class='c013'>After a conflict of two hours, San Carlos was
the only point of defense left to the Spaniards,
and that too, threatened by a new foe. Bienville
was in its rear ready for an assault, which he
soon boldly made. He was, however, so much
impeded by the stockade that he withdrew his
men until he could be better prepared for another
attack. In the assault, it is said, his Indian
allies emulated the French soldiers in daring and
in their efforts to tear away the impeding
stockade. But their war-whoop was more
effectual and decisive than their valor. Impressing
the Spaniards, as it did, with visions of
blood-dripping scalps, it disposed them to
obviate by surrender the dire consequences of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>successful assault, for they felt that Bienville,
however so disposed, would be powerless to
stay the Indian’s scalping knife when his blood
was at battle heat. Accordingly, before the
assault was repeated, Metamoras signaled for
a parley, which resulted not in a capitulation
on terms which he asked for, but in a surrender
at discretion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even after the cooling process of the time required
for the parley and arranging the surrender,
the Indians were so loath to forego their
scalping pastime, the precious boon of victory,
that it was necessary for Bienville to redeem the
scalps of the Spaniards by bestowing one-half
of their effects upon his allies, and reserving the
other half only for his own soldiers.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Don Alphonso, the commander of
the Spanish fleet, surrendered his sword to
Champmeslin, the latter returned it with the
complimentary assurance that the Don was
worthy to wear it. But Bienville would not
even condescend to accept that of Metamoras,
but directed him to deliver it to a by-standing
soldier.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the real hero of this battle, like the real
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>heroes of many other fields of glory, must be
unnamed, for though it is recorded that the
pilot of the <i>Hercules</i> was rewarded with a
patent of nobility for his skill and daring, there
is no accessible record of his name.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having won a surrender at discretion, it was
Bienville’s pleasure to send Metamoras and a
sufficient number of Spanish troops to Havana,
in a Spanish vessel, to be exchanged for the
Frenchmen who had been sent there in August;
and thus it was that he worked the deliverance
of his brother Chateaugné from his imprisonment
in Mora Castle. The rest of the Spaniards
were sent to France as prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was his will and pleasure likewise to burn
the town of Pensacola, and to utterly destroy
San Carlos by blowing it up with powder. The
only structure left undestroyed was the magazine
which stood about half a mile from the
fort.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon the ruins of San Carlos there was fixed
a tablet announcing: “In the year 1718, on
the eighteenth day of September, Monsieur Desnard
de Champmeslin, Commander of His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Most Christian Majesty, captured this place
and the Island of Santa Rosa by force of arms.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus did the Pensacola of Arriola, after having
been a shuttlecock in the cruel game of war—captured,
recaptured and captured again
within four months—perish utterly in the
throes of a convulsion and the glare of a conflagration;
a fate which may be traced to the
intrigues of Cardinal Alberoni, the ambitious
and crafty minister of Philip V., resulting in a
war in which Spain, without an ally, was confronted
by the united arms of France, Great
Britain, Holland and Austria. “I quickened a
corpse” was the vain boast by which he expressed
the change he had effected in Spanish
policy, one of the many disastrous consequences
of which was the ending in fire and blood of a
little settlement on the far-off shores of the new
world.</p>

<p class='c012'>On February 17, 1720, five months after the
destruction of Pensacola, a treaty of peace between
France and Spain was signed. But it
was not until early in January, 1723, that
Bienville, under orders from the French government,
formally restored Pensacola to the Spaniards,
or rather its site and surroundings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the first settlement of the Island town
there exists no account, but it is probable it
began immediately after the destruction of the
Pensacola of Arriola. Its origin may be accounted
for by the natural precaution of Governor
Metamoras upon his recapture of that place
and preparation for a struggle with the French,
to remove the non-combatants to a place of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>safety, or rather the safest in the vicinity, and
there was none possessing such great advantages
as Santa Rosa island. It was a
narrow, uninhabited strip of land, separated
from the main land in its western portion by
three miles of water, rendering a settlement
there comparatively free from the danger of surprise
by the Indians. The deepest water for
landing on the bay-side, and a supply of fresh
water obtainable by digging wells, would
naturally determine the location of the settlement;
and these conditions were met by a
place about two miles from the western point
of the island, not far from the present bay-wharf
of the life-saving station.</p>

<p class='c013'>The progress the settlement made in the course
of a quarter of a century is presented by the
annexed engraving, which is taken from a
sketch made in 1743. The artist, Don Serres,
who was a resident during that year, came

for in that year it was destroyed, together with
many of its people, by a terrific hurricane.
And thus it was that, as the Pensacola of
Arriola perished in the conflict of human passions,
its offspring was destroyed in a war of
the elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>The survivors, removing to the north shore of
the Bay, settled upon a crescent-shaped body of
dry land, about the eighth of a mile wide in its
widest part, formed by the Bay and a titi
swamp, which, extending from the mouth of an
estuary on the west, curved landward to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>marsh just below the outlet of another on the
east. These estuaries, though seemingly the
outlets of two, were in fact those of one and
the same stream flowing through the swamp,
and navigable by canoes for some distance from
the bay. The bay-shore also curved deeply, the
indentation being in fact the remnant of a cove,
which, as old maps show, extended to and beyond
the northern edge of the swamp.</p>

<p class='c013'>That settlement was but a removal of Pensacola
to its present site, like that by which it
was removed to the island. Each settlement,
in its order of time, like d’ Arriola’s town, being
a continuation of the Pensacola founded by de
Luna in 1559, four years before Menendez
founded St. Augustine.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the history of the present Pensacola, beyond
its bare existence, from 1754 to 1763, we
have no information further than that its insignificance
shielded it from the trials and sufferings
of the seven years war ended by the treaty
of Paris, February 10, 1763.</p>

<p class='c013'>By that treaty Florida became a British
colony. On July 6 of that year Captain Wills,
in command of the third battery of Royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Artillery, then at Havana, forming a part of
the British force which had captured the city
during the late war, was ordered by General
Keppel to proceed with his command to Pensacola
for the purpose of taking possession of the
place. Arriving thereon the seventh of August,
Captain Wills having presented the order of the
king of Spain to the Spanish commander for the
surrender of the post, it was promptly obeyed.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the duty of Spain under the treaty to
remove her troops from Pensacola. Her subjects,
however, were, under the Nineteenth article,
entitled to remain in the full enjoyment of their
personal rights, religion and property; but, resolving
to remove to Mexico, they applied to
the Spanish government for transportation,
which was promptly promised. Accordingly,
on September 2, transports for the removal of
the garrison and people arrived; and, on the
third, the Spanish troops and the entire population,
to the last man, woman and child,
sailed for Vera Cruz, leaving Captain Wills and
his command the only occupants of the town.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is to a report written by him a few days
after the Spanish exodus that we owe all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>information we possess of the character and
appearance of the town at that time.</p>

<p class='c013'>It consisted of “40 huts, thatched with
palmetto leaves, and barracks for a small
garrison, the whole surrounded by a stockade
of pine posts.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The report says: “The country, from the
insuperable laziness of the Spaniards, still remains
uncultivated. The woods are still near
the village, and a few paltry gardens show the
only improvements. Stock, they have none,
being entirely supplied by Mobile, which is
pretty well cultivated and produces sufficient
for export.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the Indians we are presented with the following
glimpse: “The Indians are numerous
around. We had within a few days a visit from
about two hundred of five different nations. I
was sorry not to have it in my power of making
them any presents. I only supplied them with
some rum, with which they seemed satisfied,
and went off assuring me of their peaceful intentions
and promising to come down soon
with some of their principal chiefs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The church, which is so hallowing a feature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>in the sketch of the Island Town, is suggestive
of the persevering devotion of the Catholic
Faith to the spiritual welfare of her children.
In 1559, when de Luna raised his national flag
upon the shores of Santa Maria, his spiritual
mother raised her cross beside it. With that
sacred symbol she followed him in his explorations
through the limitless wilderness, beginning
and ending each day with her holy rites. She
returned with Arriola, and, as he built his fort,
her children under her pious promptings built
her church. As the drum beat the reveille to
call the soldier to the activities of life, the notes
of her bell reminded him of her presence to
admonish and console him. The engraving
presents the next effort of her zeal. Afterwards,
when the wing of the hurricane and the wild
fury of the waves had swept away her island
sanctuary, and left her children houseless on a
desolate shore, she followed them to that
hamlet which has just been described, where,
around a rude altar, sheltered by the frail
thatch of the palmetto, they enjoyed her consoling
offices. When, in 1763, their national
flag fell from the staff and her people went into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>voluntary exile, her cross went with them as
their guide and solace. She returned with
Galvez, and never for a day since then has she
been without her altar and her priest on these
shores to perform her rites for the living and the
dead. For many years after the establishment
of American rule, that altar and that priest
were the only means by which the Protestant
mother, more obedient to the Divine word than
sectarian prejudice, could obey the sacred
mandate: “Suffer the little children to come
unto Me, and forbid them not.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>British West Florida—Pensacola the Capital—Government
Established—Johnstone first Governor—British Settlers—First
Survey of the Town—Star Fort—Public Buildings—Resignation
of Johnstone—His Successor, Monteforte
Brown.</p>

<p class='c012'>The little settlement, mentioned in the last
chapter, soon attained an importance in striking
contrast with its appearance and condition.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the treaty of Paris, France had ceded to
Great Britain Canada, and that part of Louisiana
east of a line beginning at the source of
the Mississippi river and running through its
centre to the Iberville river, thence through the
middle of this river, lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain,
to the Gulf. That acquisition, with
Florida, extended the British North American
empire from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic
Sea, bringing alike the Seminoles and Esquimaux
under its dominion.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the seventh of October, 1763, by a royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>proclamation the limits of the governments of
East and West Florida were established; the former
extending from the Apalachicola river eastward;
the latter embracing all the territory
lately acquired from France and Spain south of
the parallel of 31° from the Mississippi to the
Chattahoochee river; and by another exercise of
royal authority, in February, 1764, the northern
boundary was pushed to 32°, 28´. This
line was also the southern boundary of the territory
of Illinois, and it brought Mobile and
Natchez within the limits of West Florida.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of that province, so extensive and so rich in
natural resources, Pensacola became the established
capital; a natural result of the high estimate
placed by the British upon the advantages
of the harbor. When Lord Bute’s ministry was
assailed in the House of Commons for having
procured Florida, by the surrender of Cuba,
which Great Britain had conquered in the war
ended by the treaty of Paris, the acquisition of
the Bay of Pensacola figures as a prominent
feature in the ministerial defense.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first step towards the establishment of
civil government in West Florida was taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>upon the arrival, in February, 1764, at Pensacola,
of Commodore George Johnstone of the
Royal Navy, who came as the governor of the
province; his first official act being a proclamation
announcing his presence, powers, jurisdiction,
as well as the laws which were to be
in force. There came with him the Twenty-first
British regiment as a garrison for the post, and
also a number of civilians in search of fortune,
or new homes; some as parasites, who are never
absent where public money is to be distributed,
and others attracted by the charms of the <a id='e2'></a>distant,
under the delusive misrepresentations of
which the immigrant is so often the victim.</p>

<p class='c013'>In November, 1764, Governor Johnstone, under
instructions from the British government—which
from the first seems to have taken a deep
interest in the development of its late acquisitions—published
a description of the province
for the purpose of attracting settlers. By
efforts like this, a tide of immigration soon began
to flow into West Florida, which, during
the British dominion of nearly twenty years, it
is estimated, brought into it a population of
25,000. In this inflow were observable a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>number of Africans, imported under official encouragement,
to clear the forests and till the
fields of the province; the British conscience
being, then, still enthralled by the greedy slave-traders
of Bristol, Liverpool and London, was
patiently awaiting the advent of Clarkson and
Wilberforce, to quicken it into resistance to the
cruel traffic.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the early days of Governor Johnstone’s administration,
Pensacola was surveyed and a
plan established. The main street was named
George, for King George III., and the second
street eastward Charlotte, for Queen Charlotte.
The area between those streets as far north as
what is now Intendencia street was not surveyed
into blocks and lots, but reserved as a
public place or park. The lots south of Garden
street had an area of 80 feet front and 170 in
depth. North of that street they were 192 feet
square, known as arpent or Garden lots, and
numbered to correspond with those lying south
of Garden street, which were, strictly speaking,
town lots. In order to furnish each family with
a garden spot, each grantee of a town lot was
entitled, upon the condition of improvement, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>receive a conveyance of an arpent lot of the
same number as his town lot.</p>

<p class='c013'>That plan, which was the work of Elias
Durnford, appointed, on the twenty-sixth of
July, 1764, civil engineer of the province, is still
the plan of the old part of Pensacola, with some
changes in what was the English park, or
public place; and therefore the plan of the town
is, strictly speaking, of English origin.</p>

<p class='c013'>The park, however, though excluded from
private ownership, was not intended to be vacant,
but on the contrary, was devoted to public
uses. In the centre of it was a star-shaped
stockade fort, designed as a place of refuge for
the population in case of an Indian attack.
Near it were the officers’ quarters, barracks,
guard house, ordnance store-house and laboratory,
two powder magazines, the King’s
bake-house, cooperage shelter, and government
store-house. This park was, therefore, in the
early days of Pensacola, the liveliest and busiest
part of the town.</p>

<p class='c013'>The star-shaped fort was, from 1764 until
after 1772, the only fortification of the town,
as may be inferred from the official report of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Captain Thomas Sowers, engineer, on the fifth
of April of the latter year.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first street pushed through the crescent-shaped
swamp, was George street, involving
much labor in building a causeway and covering
it with earth. It extended to the elevation,
then named Gage Hill, in honor of General Gage,
of Boston memory, and who, as the commander-in-chief
of all the royal forces in the British
North American colonies, had much to do with
Pensacola in its early days. Upon the highest
point of this hill was established a lookout
from which the approaches of the town landward
and seaward could be observed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Governor Johnstone, who was a commodore
in the royal navy, in the second year of his administration,
found himself in jarring relations
with the military, resulting from circumstances
which, at this distance of time, seem to be trifles,
but magnified, when they occurred, into importance
by that jealous sensitiveness which
appears to exist always between those two
arms of the public service. As might be expected,
whisperers, busybodies, and parasites, thronging
the seat of patronage, ready to catch any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>stray crumb of official favor, aggravated the
conflict, which at last became so bitter and
widespread that we find it figuring in the records
of the courts-martial of a major, a lieutenant,
and even an ensign. Naturally, too, the colonists
at length became partisans of the official strife,
thereby contributing to bring about a condition
of affairs rendering the governor’s further continuance
in office so uninviting to himself and
so unsatisfactory to the people that, in December,
1766, he resigned.</p>

<p class='c013'>An incident which occurred shortly after his
appointment, manifests his impatience of criticism—a
weakness which may have been the
cause of his troubles in Florida. He and Grant,
governor of East Florida, were appointed at
the same time by the Bute administration, when
Scotch appointees to office were so ill-favored
by the English. The announcement were made
in the <i>North Briton</i> with a sarcastic allusion to
them as a brace of Scotchmen. At this Johnstone
was so much incensed that he sent to the
publishers what was equivalent to a challenge.
Moreover, on meeting with a Mr. Brooks, who
was connected with the <i>North Briton</i>, Johnstone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>insisted on his stating whether he was the
author of the article. Brooks refusing to answer,
Johnstone drew his sword to use on him
when by-standers interfered. Brooks instituted
legal proceedings under which the governor was
bound to keep the peace.</p>

<p class='c013'>In after years, Johnstone became a member of
Parliament, and attracted much attention by
casting, in the House of Commons, one of the
only two negative votes on the Boston Harbor
Bill, Edmund Burke casting the other. His
course on that memorable occasion secured him
such consideration with the Americans as to
induce the British government to select him as
one of the five commissioners who were sent to
America in 1778, under Lord North’s conciliatory
bill, intended to concede to the colonies all,
and even more, than they had demanded at the
beginning of the controversy with the Mother
country. But the sequel of his mission proved
his unfitness for the position. Besides venturing
to enter into correspondence with Robert
Morris and Francis Dana, he attempted, through
a lady, to bribe General Joseph Reed of Pennsylvania
by an offer of £10,000 and the highest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>office within the gift of the crown in America in
the event his efforts at conciliation proving successful.
To that offer Reed made the memorable
reply: “I am not worth purchasing, but such as
I am the King of Great Britain is not rich
enough to do it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The other commissioners, Mr. Eden, General
Clinton, and Lord Carlisle, at least, disavowed
all knowledge or connection with Johnstone’s
course. His conduct became the subject of resolutions
passed by Congress, in which it was declared:
“That it is incompatible with the honor
of Congress to hold any manner of intercourse
with the said George Johnstone, especially to
negotiate with him upon affairs in which the
cause of liberty is interested.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From that reflection he sought to vindicate
himself by an ill-tempered address, which was
followed by his resignation from the commission.</p>

<p class='c013'>Though a Scotchman, he seems in this affair
to have acted with more of the impulse of a
Frenchman, like Genet, than with the cool deliberation
characteristic of his race. Though he
had been a commodore in the British navy, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>his appointment of governor of West Florida
his historical designation is “Governor Johnstone.”</p>

<p class='c013'>By virtue of his being lieutenant-governor,
Monteforte Brown became Johnstone’s successor.</p>

<p class='c013'>The troops stationed at Pensacola during
Governor Johnstone’s time were the Thirty-first
regiment of infantry and the second battalion of
Royal Artillery, under General Taylor. In 1765,
these troops suffered from scurvy, as a remedy
for which the governor undertook means to
provide them with fresh meat, a provision which
it would seem a thoughtful and considerate
ruler would have employed as a preventive, instead
of waiting until disease required it as a
remedy.</p>

<p class='c013'>The scourge, however, proved a blessing in
the end, as our ills often do, by turning attention
to the necessity of securing regular supplies of
vegetable food, the acids of which science had
determined to be the preventive of scorbutic
affections. This led to the clearing, draining
and cultivation of large bodies of the Titi
Swamp, a process which, once begun, was continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>throughout the period of English rule,
until the town was surrounded by smiling
gardens, extending westward almost to Bayou
Chico, of which this generation has evidence in
the absence of forest from the district and its
meadow-like appearance, as well as its intersections
of choked up ditches and drains.</p>

<p class='c013'>In October, 1766, there was an exhibition in
Pensacola of the cruelty with which the British
soldier was treated in the last century. For
absence without leave, James Baker Mattross
of the Royal Artillery received 100 lashes under
sentence of a court-martial. Harsh as this sentence
may seem, it was mild and humane compared
with what was inflicted in other instances
at other military posts. Soldiers of the Royal
American regiment, stationed at Detroit, were
punished for rioting, as follows:<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a> James Wilkins,
Derby McCaffny, and Sargeant Deck 1000
lashes each, whilst fortunate Corporal Saums
escaped with only 500, but who, even in his
luck, was yet five times less lucky than the
royal artilleryman at Pensacola. These terrible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>inflictions provoke inquiry as to the dermal texture
of the backs of the British soldiery of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the possibility of such suffering before
them, we can appreciate the joy with which
Richard Harris of the Thirty-first regiment,
charged with stealing chickens, and Lewis Crow
on trial for selling liquor, who were tried by
court-martial at the same time as Mattross,
received their respective findings of not guilty.</p>

    <div>General Bouquet—General Haldimand.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Early in 1765 General Henry Bouquet having
been assigned to the command of the
southern military district of the colonies, of
which Pensacola was the headquarters, sailed
from Philadelphia in a small schooner for that
place. He arrived there in the early spring,
and on the following September died.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Of the
day and cause of his death nothing seems to be
known. Of the fact that his grave was marked
by a monument, there is the most conclusive
proof.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Where is that monument? That time and the
elements are responsible for its disappearance
is improbable. That it is not even a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>subject of tradition suggests the painful suspicion
that it was willfully destroyed; a suggestion
which explains the absence of all memorials
of the people who must have died in Pensacola
during the nearly twenty years of the British
dominion, and removes from their generation the
reproach of having had no respect for the memory
and ashes of their departed friends and
comrades.</p>

<p class='c013'>An exodus of the English occurred in 1783, as
a future page will show, like that of the Spaniards
in 1763 already mentioned. The town
was filled by a new and strange population,
whose needs for building material were urgent,
and their reverence for the dead too feeble, perhaps,
to resist the temptation of supplying
their wants by plundering tombs deserted by
their natural guardians.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nature, too, conspired with man in the work
of desecration. The necropolis of the English
was at the western extremity of the town, extending
southward and embracing a slight
bluff on the Bay. From 1860 to 1870 the water
abraded that place, washing out human bones,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>and thus compelled the earth to surrender its
dead to the sport of the waves.</p>

<p class='c013'>General Bouquet was born at Rolle, in the
canton of Berne, Switzerland. That he attained
so high a rank is evidence of his merit. His
masterly campaign, in 1763, against the Ohio
Indians, including the Delawares, the Shawnees,
and Mingoes, as related by the classic pen of Dr.
Kingsford, in his History of Canada,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a> is a most
interesting and striking chapter of our colonial
annals. The result was the removal of a terrible
scourge from the western borders of Pennsylvania
and Virginia, and the restoration to
liberty and to friends of three hundred white
men and women by a treaty, the terms of
which were left to the discretion of General
Bouquet by General Gage. So highly appreciated
were his skill and courage at the time that
both colonies honored him with votes of thanks
for his “great services,” which were supplemented
by a complimentary letter from the
king.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the royal letter and his promotion were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>only Dead Sea apples. Their result was a voyage
in a small vessel to the distant shores of the
Gulf of Mexico, where he was to die in a few
months in a little garrison town with his
laurels yet fresh on his brow, away from the
friends and that admiring social circle he had
left so recently at Philadelphia. Had he been
the son, or cousin, whether first, second or third,
would have mattered not, of a minister, he
would have won a pension and obtained an
enviable appointment.</p>

<p class='c013'>General Bouquet was not only a distinguished
soldier, but he also left behind him another
claim to distinction in the thirty volumes of
manuscript in the British museum, known as the
“Bouquet Collection,” which now calendared
is available to the historical student.</p>

<p class='c013'>His monument has perished; his bones, perhaps,
have been the sport of the unpitying
waves; generations have unconsciously trampled
on his dust; but, in “the Pantheon of
history,” his name and his fame are as fresh as
when on these shores he drew his last breath
and heaved his last sigh.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>A letter<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a> from his confidential friend Ourry
inspires the suspicion that a romantic passion,
nourished by exile and inaction, contributed to
his early death. He was devoted to a Miss
Willing of Philadelphia, and supposed to be her
affianced. A Mr. Francis, a wealthy Londoner,
wooed and won the lady whilst the soldier was
winning laurels on the western frontier. But
for vandal hands his tomb would be a shrine
where disappointed love could make its votive
offerings.</p>

<p class='c013'>General Frederick Haldimand was the successor
of General Bouquet in the command of
the southern district. He, too, was a Swiss,
and a native of the Canton of Berne. He had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>held important commands in Canada before he
came to Florida. In 1773 he was appointed
governor of New York. In the same year, during
General Gage’s absence in England, he was
commander-in-chief of the colonies. He was,
from 1778 to 1784, governor-general of Canada.
To the qualities of a distinguished soldier, he
added ability for civil affairs and the statesmanlike
qualities which great crises sometimes require
in a military commander, as appears from
Lord Dartmouth’s correspondence with him
during Gage’s absence.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>There is an interesting coincidence in the lives
of Bouquet and Haldimand. Drawn to each
other, doubtless, by the tie of nativity and profession,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>similarity of disposition, interests and
fortunes, a life-long friendship was the natural
consequence. They were associates in land
investments. Bouquet bequeathed his entire
estate to his native brother-in-arms, including
the valuable collection before referred to. More
fortunate than the former, the latter lived to be
made a Knight of the Bath, and to die in his
native town of Yverdun.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Governor Elliott—Social and Military Life in Pensacola—Gentlemen—Women—Fiddles—George
Street—King’s
Wharf on November 14, 1768.</p>

<p class='c012'>There exists evidence in the Canadian archives
that, in July, 1767, Mr. Elliot was appointed
to succeed Governor Johnstone, but careful
search has failed to discover any official act
upon which to rest the conclusion that he ever
came to the province.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a note dated eighteenth of October, 1768,
at Pensacola, General Haldimand tells Governor
Brown that “assistance will be given to
land Governor Elliot’s baggage, and put the
garden in order,” in answer, evidently, to a request
of Governor Brown, made in expectation
of the new governor’s early arrival. But these
preparations were manifestly made in vain, for
in a letter written at Pensacola, in January,
1769, by the general to Mr. John Bradley of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>New Orleans, he says: “I hope that these matters
will be settled on the arrival of Governor
Elliot, daily expected.” And numerous papers
in the Canadian archives, as well as documents
in the American state papers, show that from
the eighteenth of December, 1766, up to the appointment
of Governor Peter Chester, in 1772,
Brown was the acting governor of the province.
The evidence is therefore conclusive that though
Elliot was appointed, he either died or resigned
without ever having gone to the province.</p>

<p class='c013'>The coming of officers and others from the
military posts of the province to headquarters,
as well as the frequent courts-martial held there,
especially numerous and exciting in 1766-7,
enlivened military life at Pensacola.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the social life of the town during Johnstone’s
and Brown’s administrations, we have
but little information. If, however, the opinion
of an official high in rank is to be accepted as
evidence, gentlemen were not numerous up to
1767, as will be seen from an extract from a
letter of his to a friend: “A ship lately arrived
from London, has brought over the chief justice
and the attorney-general of the province, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span><em>other gentlemen, who are very much wanted</em>.”
But who are and who are not gentlemen? Let
the moralist, the sectarian, partisan, votary of
sport or fashion, dude, friend, enemy, the prejudiced,
the just, the harsh, and the charitable
successively sit in judgment upon the same man;
what a very chameleon in character will he not
appear, as he is reviewed by each of his judges?
Of this variety of judgments, an occurrence, at
Pensacola during this period, is illustrative.</p>

<p class='c013'>Major Farmer of the Thirty-fourth regiment
of infantry, stationed at Fort Charlotte,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a> was
by the Johnstone party accused of embezzlement
and fraud. But a court-martial which sat at
Pensacola honorably acquitted him, and upon a
review of the record the finding of the court was
approved by the King.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another letter, in 1770, gives the following uninviting
picture of the civil as well as the social
condition of the place: “Pensacola has been
justly famed for vexatious law-suits. It is contrived,
indeed, that if a poor man owes but five
pounds, and has not got so much ready money,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>or if he disputes some dollars of imposition that
may be in the account, or if he is guilty of shaking
his fist at any rascal that has abused him,
he is sure to be prosecuted, and the costs of
every suit are about seven pounds sterling....
I have known this province for a little more than
four years, yet I could name to you a set of men
who may brag of one governor resigned, one
horse-whipped and one whom they led by the
nose and supported while it suited their purpose,
and then betrayed him. What the next turn of
affairs will be, God knows.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps, however, the writer owed a shopkeeper
who sued him; or he had been fined for
offering violence to some other importunate
creditor; and as to the costs of litigation, it is
likely, that in this year of grace some luckless
litigant, in the modern Pensacola, can be found
who would heave a sympathetic sigh on reading
the complaint which comes to us from a suitor
in its early days.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides, the reference to the treatment received
by three governors, in a letter written in 1770,
is rather puzzling, for though three governors
had been appointed for West Florida up to that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>time, but two, Johnstone and Brown, administered
its government. Johnstone resigned and,
therefore, Brown must have been the man, if
any, who was horsewhipped and led by the nose.
As “led by the nose,” however, is a metaphor,
“horsewhipped” may, perhaps, be regarded as
a figure of speech likewise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Strange though it be, yet so it is, in the mass
of Pensacola correspondence, from 1763 to 1770,
we find mention made of military officers of
every grade, governors, secretaries, surveyors,
judges, male Indians, ships, boats, bricks, lumber,
shingles, wine, swords, muskets, cheese,
cannon and fiddles, but of a woman or any of
her belongings, never, with only two exceptions.</p>

<p class='c013'>One comes to us like an attractive mirage on
the far-off horizon of this Sahara of masculinity
and soulless things in the person of Mrs. Hugh
Wallace of Philadelphia, a friend of General
Haldimand, in respect to whom, in a letter to
her husband, he says: “I beg my best respects
may be acceptable to Mrs. Wallace.” The other
is a nameless moral wreck, of whom the writer
of a letter exclaims: “I wish I could make the
mother of my children my wife!” forcing upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>the imagination the shadow of a wronged wife,
with one’s heart touched by the probable sorrows
of a blighted life.</p>

<p class='c013'>But, though excluded from men’s letters, we
do not need their correspondence to inform us
that wives, mothers, sisters and nurses formed
no inconsiderable part of the population of Pensacola
in those early days, for we know it as
certainly, fully, and confidently as we know
the town must have been blessed with air, light,
food, and all the other vivifying conditions of
human existence.</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been intimated that fiddles were the
subject of correspondence, and thuswise. It
appears that General Haldimand was the owner
of two fiddles. Whether fiddling was one of his
accomplishments does not appear. But as ownership
of one fiddle ordinarily creates the presumption
that the owner is a performer in some
one of the three degrees of good, bad or indifferent,
the ownership of two would seem to be
conclusive of the fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>However that may be, it seems that Governor
Thomas Penn of Pennsylvania had knowledge
of the instruments, and, presumably, knowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>their merits, coveted them to such a degree that
the general induced him to pay $360 for them.
As the bargain was made by letter, after the
general and the fiddles had been in Pensacola
for several years, we may infer that their dulcet
tones must have made a deep and ineffaceable
impression upon the governor, which no other
fiddles could remove. By a vessel sailing from
Pensacola to Philadelphia, the general sent a
box containing the two fiddles to Mr. Joseph
Shipping of that place, agent of Governor Penn,
and also a letter to Hugh Ross, his own agent,
whom he tells (evidently with the chuckle of a
trader who has made a good bargain) of the
$360 he is to collect from Shipping, closing the
letter with the exclamation, “I wish I had more
fiddles to sell!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Correspondence in 1767 shows courtesies exchanged
between Pensacola and Philadelphia.
A Pensacolian sends a sea turtle, and the Philadelphian
returns a cheese.</p>

<p class='c013'>The town was accused of being hot and inhospitable.
But the letter of complaint tells what
a specific wine is for the prevention of all
climatic diseases and the other ills of life. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>gentleman, to be sure of a supply of the panacea,
orders a pipe of old Madeira.</p>

<p class='c013'>On November 14, 1768, we are walking down
the east side of George street from the gardens
to the Bay. After passing two blocks we find
ourselves on the Public Square and in front of a
large building. Going in and out of that building
are many people, the most of them soldiers
and Indians, and somewhere in or about it we
find a Mr. Arthur Neil. Upon inquiry we are
informed the building is the king’s store-house,
and Mr. Neil its keeper. Leaving the store, a
short walk brings us to the shore and afterwards
to the king’s wharf, which we see covered
with troops, some of them getting into boats,
whilst others, already embarked, are going to
a ship lying at anchor. That ship is the <i>Pensacola</i>
bound for Charleston, South Carolina.
The troops are the Thirty-first regiment, lately
stationed at Mobile, whence they have just arrived,
after an overland march, for the purpose
of embarking in the <i>Pensacola</i>. Whether they
shall remain at Charleston in winter quarters
will, according to a letter of General Haldimand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>to Colonel Chisolm, “depend upon the
conduct of the Bostonians.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Governor Peter Chester—Fort George of the British and
St. Michael of the Spanish—Tartar Point—Red Cliff.</p>

<p class='c012'>Peter Chester, having been commissioned
governor of West Florida in 1772, came to Pensacola,
the capital of the province, and entered
upon the administration of the office. He was
recognized and deferred to by General Haldimand
as a man of capacity and experience, a
reputation which was not impaired by his nine
years’ rule in Florida.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first days of his administration were
marked by a determination to reform the public
service, and to supersede the old star fort by
more stable and efficient defenses for the town
and harbor, and the spirit which animated him
was at once communicated to the military commander
of the province.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early in his administration, after much discussion
by engineers of several plans for the defense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>of the town, a fort was built, under orders
from General Gage, on Gage Hill, and named
Fort George for his majesty George III.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In the centre of the fortress was the council
chamber of the province and the repository of
its archives, where the office duties of the governor
and the military commander were performed,
where audience was given to Indian
chiefs and delegations, and where really centered
the government of West Florida, according to
its English boundaries.</p>

<p class='c013'>In that chamber on one occasion could have
been seen a man in the prime of life, partly in
Indian dress, in earnest conversation with Governor
Chester and William Panton, the millionaire
and merchant prince of the Floridas. By
the evident admixture of white and Indian blood
in his veins, his skin had lost several shades of
the hue, his hair the peculiar stiffness, and his
cheek bones somewhat of the prominence of
those of his aboriginal ancestry. He was tall
and slender; his eyes, black and piercing, beamed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>with the light that belongs to those of the cultured;
the Indians said his high forehead was
arched like a horse-shoe; the fingers which hold
the pen with which he is writing, during a pause
in the conversation, are long and slender; he
speaks and then reads what he has written; all
is in the purest English, to which he is capable
of giving point by an apt classical quotation.
On a future occasion he will enter that chamber
with the commission of a British colonel. A
few years later he will hold a like commission
from the King of Spain. A few years later still
will find him a brigadier-general of the United
States. That man is Alexander McGillivray, of
whom much is to be written.</p>

<p class='c013'>In that chamber three men were once seated
at a table, attended by two secretaries busily
writing, one in English, the other in Spanish.
One of the three is Governor Chester, another is
General John Campbell, a distinguished English
officer whom fortune has just deserted. The
third, a young-looking Spaniard, too young for
his insignia of a Spanish general, is Don Bernardo
de Galvez, the governor and military commander
of Louisiana. Those three men are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>closing a drama and writing the last paragraph
of a chapter of history. The two papers the
secretaries are writing, when signed, will separate,
one going to London, the other to Madrid,
to meet again at Versailles. At Versailles they
will be copied substantially into the duplicates
of the treaty of 1783 between Spain and Great
Britain, and constitute its V Article.</p>

<p class='c013'>A pigeon-hole on the side of that chamber once
contained an order from Lord Dartmouth, dated
January, 1774, to the commander-in-chief of
West Florida, to forward a regiment from Pensacola
to revolutionary Boston to quell the tea-riots.
This book is debtor to many documents
which once rested in other pigeon-holes of the
chamber.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fort George was a quadrangle with bastions
at each corner. There were within the fort a
powder magazine and barracks for the garrison,
besides the chamber above mentioned. The
woods north of it, for an eighth of a mile, and
within a curve bending around it to the bay,
were felled, in order to give play to its guns landward,
whilst they could bear upon an enemy in
the bay by firing over the town. By a system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>of signals, intercommunication was kept up with
Tartar Point and thence with Red Cliff.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tartar Point, now the site of the Navy Yard,
where a battery and barracks were erected by
the British, is the only existing name in this
part of West Florida which carries one’s
thoughts back to the days of British rule. The
name of the point under the second Spanish
dominion, which lasted about forty years, was
<i>Punta de la Asta Bandera</i>—the Point of the Flagstaff.
It seems strange that an English name
which had been superseded for that period by a
Spanish designation, should after that lapse of
time be restored.</p>

<p class='c013'>The locality of Red Cliff was for a time a puzzle.
Such a name for a locality at once induced
a search for a suggestive aspect. No red bluff,
however, not too far eastward to serve as the
site of a work for the defense of the town or
harbor, could be found, and yet, no bluff westward
of the former could be observed to suit the
designation. But at length, a letter in the
Canadian archives fixed Barrancas as the locality
by stating that there was at about the distance
of a half to a quarter of a mile from Red
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Cliff a powder magazine, built by the Spaniards,
capable of holding 500 barrels of powder, which
was then being used as the powder depôt of the
province, evidently the relic of old San Carlos,
destroyed by the French in 1719, and stood on
the site of the present Fort Redoubt.</p>

<p class='c013'>The defenses of Red Cliff consisted of two batteries,
“one on the top and the other at the foot
of the hill.” There were quarters for the officers
and barracks for the soldiers in one building, so
constructed as to be proof against musket balls
and available as an ample defense against an
Indian attack.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

    <div>Representative Government.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>When the governments of West and East
Florida were established, as before related, their
governors were, severally, vested with authority,
their councils consenting and the condition of
the provinces being favorable, to call for the
election of general assemblies by the people.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1773, Governor Chester concluded that the
time had arrived when it would be expedient for
him to exercise this power. He, accordingly,
issued writs authorizing an election, fixing the
time it was to be held, the voting precincts, the
qualifications of voters, and the number and
qualifications of assemblymen to be chosen, as
well as the day of the sitting of the general
assembly at Pensacola.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the writs, unhappily, fixed the terms of
assemblymen at three years; a provision
which proved fatal, not only to this first attempt,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>but likewise to all future efforts to
establish representative government in West
Florida. The election was held throughout the
province, and the members of a full general
assembly elected. But whilst the people went
to the polls with alacrity, and hailed with
pleasure the advent of popular government,
they were opposed to the long tenure fixed by
Governor Chester; and so determined was that
opposition that they resolved that it should not
receive the implied sanction of their votes.
They accordingly cast ballots which declared
that they were subject to the condition that the
representative should hold for one year only.
To that condition the governor refused to consent.
The people, on the other hand, were
equally unyielding in their opposition. Efforts
were made, but in vain, to induce a concession
by one side or the other; consequently, during
the following years of English dominion, as before,
the province knew no other civil government
than that of the governor and his council.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is difficult to understand the motives which
prompted the people to so stubborn an opposition.
The tenure of three years might, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>seem long to voters who had probably lived in
colonies, where it was a third or two-thirds less.
But still, if there was any value to a people in
representative government, surely an assembly
holding for three years was better than none;
especially as it would have so concentrated the
influence and power of the community as to enable
it at some auspicious conjuncture to remove
the one popular objection to the system.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, we can better appreciate
the conduct of Governor Chester. An Englishman
with the Tory conservatism of that day,
he would, naturally, fear the effect of short
terms and frequent elections, aside from economical
considerations. All the northern colonies
were in a state of ferment bordering on revolution,
and that consideration, doubtless, intensified
his opposition to anything that savored of
opposition to the wishes of the king or his
representatives. Indeed, from his stand-point,
to yield to the popular wishes in array against
his own will and judgment, was to leaven the
province with a pestilent political heresy which
was seeking to substitute the power of the
people for the authority of the crown.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Governor Chester seems to have possessed
superior talents for government, the best
evidence of which is found in the prosperity of
the colony during his administration, the
harmony that existed between him and the
military, and the high respect and deference he
received from General Haldimand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such a man, conscious of his rectitude and
good intentions towards the province, evinced
by his readiness to afford it the privilege of
representative government, somewhat at the
expense of his own authority, would naturally
feel that the condition attached to the ballots,
and adhered to with much insistance, manifested
such a want of confidence in him as to justify
his distrust of the people.</p>

<p class='c013'>But what Governor Chester’s zealous endeavors
could not accomplish in West Florida,
the reluctant efforts of Governor Tonyn achieved
in the eastern province. In 1780, the latter,
against his own wishes, and solely at the suggestion
of others, called for the election of a
general assembly. The call having been promptly
obeyed, the first popular representative body in
Florida met at St. Augustine in January, 1781.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Growth of Pensacola—Panton, Leslie &amp; Co.—A King and
the Beaver—Governor Chester’s Palace and Chariot—The
White House of the British, and Casa Blanca of
the Spanish—General Gage—Commerce—Earthquake.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is evidence of great improvement in
the town within a few years from Governor
Chester’s advent; a progress which was accelerated
as the revolution in the Northern Colonies
advanced. That great movement, ever widening
its area, extended at last from the Gulf
to Canada, leaving no repose or peace for those
who, living within it, were resolute to remain
loyal to their king.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some entered the royal military service; multitudes
left America, and others, to nurse their
loyalty in quietude, removed to Florida.
Though most of that emigration went to East
Florida, yet West Florida, and especially Pensacola,
received a large share. St. Augustine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>however, was the tory paradise of the revolutionary
era. She can, without question, supplement
the glory of her antiquity with the boast
of having once seen her streets lighted up by the
blazing effigies of John Adams and John
Hancock.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The most important commercial acquisition
of Pensacola by that tory immigration was
William Panton, the senior of the firm of Panton,
Leslie &amp; Co., a Scotch house of great
wealth and extensive commercial relations.
They had an establishment in London, with
branches in the West India Islands. During the
English dominion in Florida they established
themselves in St. Augustine; later, during Governor
Chester’s administration, at Pensacola,
and afterwards, at Mobile. Other merchants
also came to Pensacola about the same time,
attracted principally by the heavy disbursements
of the government. But these expenditures
were not the attraction to the Scotchmen.
Their object was to grasp the Indian trade of
West Florida. A building which they erected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>with a wharf in front of it is still standing, or at
least, its solid brick walls are now those of the
hospital of Dr. James Herron, whose dwelling
house stands on the site of the Council Chamber
of Fort George.</p>

<p class='c013'>In that building was carried on a business
which grew steadily from year to year during
the British dominion, and afterwards attained
great magnitude under Spanish rule, as we shall
have occasion to notice in a future page. In
building up that business, Panton had a most
able and influential coadjutor in General Alexander
McGillivray, whom we lately saw in the
Council Chamber of Fort George. Through
him their business comprehended not only West
Florida, but extended to and even beyond the
Tennessee river. In perfect security, their long
lines of pack horses went to and fro in that
great stretch of country, carrying all the supplies
the Indians needed, and bringing back
skins, peltry, bees-wax, honey, dried venison,
and whatever else their savage customers
would provide for barter. Furs were a large
item of that traffic, for the beaver in those days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>abounded throughout West Florida, and was
found even in the vicinity of Pensacola.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of their ponds, still existing on Carpenter’s
Creek, four miles from the town, is suggestive
of an instructive comparison between the
fruits of the life-work of its humble constructors,
and those of the twenty years rule, of a
mighty monarch. Of the British dominion of
his Majesty George III., in this part of Florida,
the millions of treasure expended, and the thousands
of lives sacrificed to establish and maintain
it, there exists no memorial, or result,
except a fast disappearing bank of sand on the
site of Fort George. From that barren outcome
of such a vast expenditure of human life and
money, we turn with a blush for the vanity and
folly of man, to contemplate that little pool
fringed with fairy candles,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a> where the water
lilies bloom, and the trout and perch flash in the
sunlight, as the memento of a perished race,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>whose humble labors have furnished pastime
and food to successive generations of anglers.</p>

<p class='c013'>An unsuccessful effort has been made to
obtain reliable information as to the number
and description of the houses Pensacola contained
in its most thriving days during Governor
Chester’s administration. But the only account
we have, is that of William Bertram, who
though reputed an eminent botanist is
hardly reliable, for he describes Governor Chester’s
residence as a “stone palace, with a cupola
built by the Spaniards;”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a> and yet, according
to the description of the town in Captain
Will’s report, at the close of Spanish rule,
it consisted of “forty huts and barracks, surrounded
by a stockade;” and he witnessed at
that time, the exodus of the entire Spanish population.
Besides, persons whose memories
went back within thirty years of Governor
Chester’s alleged palatial residence, neither saw,
nor even heard, of the ruins of such a structure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon the same authority rests the statement,
that the Governor had a farm to which he took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>morning rides in “his chariot.”<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a> But a traveler
whose fancy was equal to the transformation
of a hut into a palace, may have transformed
his excellency’s modest equipage into a
more courtly vehicle.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is probable, however, that although Governor
Chester was not the occupant of a stone palace
with a cupola, he lived in a sightly and comfortable
dwelling built of brick or wood, or perhaps
of both. One such dwelling of his time, that of
William Panton, was familiar, forty years ago
to the elders of this generation. It stood near
the business house of Panton, Leslie &amp; Co.
Taking its style and solidity as a guide, there
existed several houses in the town within the
last half century that could be identified as
belonging to Governor Chester’s day.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of them was the scene of a tragedy; a
husband cutting a wife’s throat fatally, his own
more cautiously, or perhaps her cervical vertibrae
had taken off the edge of the razor, for he
survived. Thereafter, none would inhabit it,
and consequently it rapidly went to ruin. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>stood on the north side of Government street, a
block and a half from Palafox. A jury acquitted
him. Why? No one could conjecture,
unless because she was his wife, and therefore
his chattel, like the cow or sheep of a butcher.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Governor Chester’s time there existed a large
double story suburban residence, which was a
distinguished feature in the landscape looking
southwesterly from Fort George, or from any
part of the Bay. It stood on the bluff between
the now Perdido R. R. and Bayou Chico.
Painted white, it became the “white house” of
the English, and “Casa Blanca” of the Spanish
dominion.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the home of a family of wealth and
social standing, composed of three—husband,
wife, and daughter, the latter a child. Gardens
belonging to it covered much of the area of that
meadow-like district already mentioned. That
home was to be the scene of a drama in three
acts; the death of a child, the death of a husband,
and a struggle of strong, martyrlike
womanhood in the toils of temptation, tried
to the lowest depth of her being, but coming
forth triumphant.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>In examining the calendar of the Haldimand
collection by Mr. Douglas Brymner, Archivest
of the Dominion of Canada, we are impressed
with the great and varied responsibility, labor,
and care, attending the office of commander in
chief of the American colonies, especially after
Great Britain’s, Canada, Florida, and Louisiana
acquisitions. His administration involved not
merely general superintendence of the military
department, but likewise embraced the minutest
details requiring expenditures of public money.
We accordingly find General Gage, during Governor
Chester’s administration, dictating letters
in respect to carpenter’s wages<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a> in Pensacola.
Again we find him busy over a controversy
which had sprung up there in respect to the
employment of a Frenchman, Pierre Rochon,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
to do carpenter’s work, and furnish shingles, to
the exclusion of Englishmen. Upon economical
grounds his excellency decided in favor of
Rochon. Pierre was evidently an active and
enterprising man. Before he came to Pensacola
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>to secure for himself all the public carpentering
and shingle business there, he had enjoyed the
like monopoly at Mobile.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again we find the General engaged with a
small matter at Red Cliff.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Lieutenant Cambell,
of the engineer department, had furnished some
carpenters who were employed there with
candles and firewood, doubtless because they
could not otherwise be procured by the men.
That act of kindness brought the benevolent lieutenant
the following scorching reproof: “I am
sorry to acquaint you that his excellency, General
Gage, is greatly displeased at your giving of the
carpenters candles and firewood; and he desires
to know by what authority you assumed to
give those allowances, or by what order they
were given? For his excellency declares, that a
shilling shall not be paid on that account.”
New York, 16 Feb. 1773. S. Sowers, Captain
of Engineers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even the quality of bricks used on the public
works at Pensacola was a matter of interest to
the commander in chief. In 1771, a brick manufactured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>by the British, and one by the Spaniards,
nearly a century before, as General Haldimand
says, were sent to headquarters at New
York, for the judgment of his excellency as to
their comparative merits.</p>

<p class='c013'>These letters impress us the more with the cares
of General Gage, when we reflect they were
written at the time of the troublesome tea business
at rebellious Boston; and when the flowing
tide of the revolution, as may be discerned from
almost every page of the calendar, was daily
rising, and threatening to sweep away the supports
of British authority in the colonies.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a former page mention is made of a Philadelphia
lady, whose name occurs in the Pensacola
correspondence of an earlier day. It is but fair,
therefore, that we should not leave unnoticed
a New York lady who is mentioned in letters of
Governor Chester’s time; the more so, because
she seems to have been one of those thrifty
housewives, who do not entirely depend upon
the tin can, and green glass jar of the shop to
supply their families with preserved fruits and
vegetables; besides, there can be brought in
with her extracts from letters, exemplary of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>courtly style, with which in Governor Chester’s
day, a gentleman returned, and a lady received
his thanks for a small courtesy.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>General Haldimand, at Pensacola, writes
Captain S. Sowers, the husband of the lady,
who is in New York:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I most respectfully ask Mrs. Sowers, to permit
me, through you, to tender to her my most
grateful thanks for the three jars of pickels.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The Captain replies: “Mrs. Sowers, with
pleasure, accepts your thanks for the pickels,
and when ye season comes for curing of them,
she will send you another collection which she
hopes will be acceptable.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In this stirring, short-hand, type-writing age,
the form of a like exchange of courtesies would
probably be: “Pickels received. Thanks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Though there was no lack of lawyers and
doctors, who it is said, lived in fine style, there
was a sad want of clergymen or preachers in the
province. There was but one of whom we have
any account up to 1779, and he was stationed
at Mobile. Stuernagel, the Waldeck Field
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Preacher, on his arrival in Pensacola, in that
year, christened a boy whose parents had been
waiting eight years to make him the subject of
the holy office. He also baptized men who had
been watching from their boyhood for an
opportunity to make their baptismal vows.
Nor can there be found a reference to church or
chapel during the English dominion.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The most prosperous and promising days Pensacola
ever saw, except those since the close of
the civil war, were from 1772 to 1781. As the
American revolution advanced, additions were
made to the numbers, intelligence and wealth
of its population, owing to causes already mentioned.
It was the capital of a province rich in
its forests, its agricultural and other resources.
Its Bay was prized as the peerless harbor of the
Gulf, which it was proposed by the British government
to make a great naval station, a
beginning in that direction having been made
by selecting a site for a navy yard adjoining the
town to the westward. Its commerce was
daily on the increase; not only in consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>of the extension of Panton, Leslie &amp; Co.’s trade
with the Indians, but other enterprising merchants
who had been added to the population,
were engaged in an export trade, comprising
pine timber and lumber, cedar, salt beef, raw
hides, cattle, tallow, pitch, bear’s oil, staves,
shingles, honey, beeswax, salt fish, myrtle wax<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a>,
deer skins, dried venison, furs and peltry. This
trade, and the £200,000 annually extended by
the British government, as well as the disbursements
of the shipping, constituted the sources
of the prosperity of the town.</p>

<p class='c013'>This period, besides being a season of growth
and prosperity to Pensacola, as well as the rest
of the Province, was one of repose, undisturbed
by the march of armies, battles, and the other
cruel shocks of war that afflicted the northern
colonies. But it was not to remain to the end
a quiet spectator of the drama enacting on the
continent. It, too, had an appointment with
fate. Though not even a faint flash of the
northern storm was seen on its horizon, yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>there had been one for long brooding for it in
the southwest.</p>

<p class='c013'>The earthquake, too, that visited it on the
night of February 6, 1780,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a> was but a presage
of that which on May 8, 1781, was to shake it to
its center; and prove the signal of an exodus of
the English almost as complete as was that of
the Spanish population in 1763.</p>

Expedition against Pensacola—Solana’s Fleet

Celebrated in Fort George.</p>

<p class='c012'>The military condition of West Florida was
changed as the revolutionary war progressed.
There were no longer seen two or more regiments
at Pensacola, one or two at Mobile, and
one at Fort Bute, Baton Rouge, and Panmure.
The call for troops for service in the northern
colonies had, by the latter part of 1778, reduced
the entire effective force of the province to five
hundred men.</p>

<p class='c013'>That such a reduction was thought prudent,
was due to the peaceful relations of the Spaniards
and the British, as well as those of the
latter with the Creek and Choctaw Indians, attributable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>to the influence of McGillivray, now
a colonel in the British service.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the latter part of 1778, however, the
British government becoming suspicious of
Spain, and anticipating her alliance with
France, ordered General Clinton to reinforce
West Florida. Accordingly, General John
Campbell, a distinguished officer, was sent to
Pensacola, with a force of 1,200 men, composed
of a regiment of Waldecks, and parts of two
regiments of Provincials from Maryland and
Pennsylvania. They did not arrive, however,
until the twenty-ninth of January, 1779.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Early in 1789, General Campbell sent two
companies of Waldecks to reinforce Fort Bute,
which brought its garrison up to about 500
men under the command of Lt. Colonel Dickson.</p>

<p class='c013'>At length Spain threw off the mask, and
adopted a course which justified the suspicions
of the British Court as to her inimical intentions.
On June 16, the Spanish minister, the
Marquis d’ Almodovar, having delivered to
Lord Weymouth a paper equivalent to a declaration
of war, immediately departed from
London without taking leave. Spain thereupon
became an ally of France, but not of the United
States. Nevertheless, under the influence of the
Court of Versailles, Don Bernardo de Galvez,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the Governor of Louisiana, on June 19,
published, at New Orleans, the proclamation
of the Spanish King, acknowledging the
independence of the United States. The dates
of these transactions furnish conclusive evidence
of a pre-arrangement, designed to
enable the Spaniards to assail the British
posts in West Florida before they could be
succored by the home government.</p>

<p class='c013'>In pursuance of that policy, Galvez at once
began his preparations for offensive operations
against Forts Bute, Baton Rouge and Panmure,
in the order in which they are mentioned.
The great distance of Pensacola from them,
as well as the want of facilities of communication,
assured him that with an adequate force
at his command, General Campbell’s first intimation
of his operations would be the news of
their capture.</p>

<p class='c013'>In August, with a force of 2,000 men, Galvez
began his advance on Fort Bute. As soon as
Dickson was informed of his movement, he resolved
to concentrate his forces at Baton Rouge,
leaving at the former post a few men to
man the guns, and to make such a show of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>resistance as would give him time to perfect the
defenses of the latter.</p>

<p class='c013'>On August 30, Galvez appeared before Bute.
After a contest of some hours, its handful of defenders
arrested his movements by the time consumed
in an honorable capitulation. Bute having
been secured, Galvez pushed on to Baton
Rouge. In his first attack, he was repulsed
with the heavy loss of 400 men killed and
wounded, which was within 100 of Dickson’s
entire force. In the next attack which was
made on the following day, the Spanish loss
was 150. Although the loss on his side was in
both attacks only 50 men, Dickson realizing
that he was cut off from all succor, and that he
must either surrender, or see his command gradually
waste away under the repeated attacks
of an overwhelming enemy, capitulated upon
the most honorable terms. The command was
pledged not to fight against Spain for eighteen
months unless sooner exchanged. With loaded
guns and flags flying the garrison was to march
to the beat of the drum 500 paces from the fort
and there stack arms. The officers were to retain
their swords and every one his private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>property. All were to be cared for and transported
to a British harbor by the Spaniards.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a>
Fort Panmure, from which the garrison had
been withdrawn for the defense of Baton Rouge,
was included in the surrender.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not until the twentieth of October that
a courier brought to Pensacola intelligence of the
fall of the Mississippi Posts, although Baton
Rouge had surrendered during the first days of
September. When it was received it was not
credited, but regarded as a false report coming
from the Spaniards to entice the British commander
from Pensacola in order that it might
be captured in his absence. Even the report of
a second courier coming, on the twenty-third,
failed at first to work conviction; but at last
all doubt was dispelled, and every effort directed
to putting Pensacola in a defensive condition.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why Galvez did not follow up his success at
Baton Rouge by an immediate advance on
Mobile, it is difficult to conceive, except upon
the presumption of his ignorance of the weakness
of the military forces there, and at Pensacola.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>In December, 1779, Clinton’s expedition
against Charleston sailed from New York; its
destination veiled in such secrecy, that even
General Washington, as well as the rest of the
world outside of the British lines, was
in the dark respecting it. Miralles, the Spanish
agent, feared it was intended to recover the conquests
of Galvez in West Florida, and signified
so much in a letter to General Washington. By
the time the letter was received, however, the
General had become convinced “that the Carolinas
were the objects,” and in reply so tells the
Spanish agent.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was during the interval of Galvez’s inaction
between the capture of Baton Rouge, and his
attack on Mobile, that Chevalier de la Luzerne
had a conference with General Washington, on
the fifteenth of September, <a id='e4'></a>1779, at West Point,
with the view of bringing about such concert of
movement in the American forces in the Carolinas
and Georgia, and the Spanish forces in
Florida, as would be a check on the British in
their movements against either.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a> But with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>every disposition for such co-operation, the latter
being without authority to that end, went
no further than to show his sympathy with
the Spaniards, and his readiness to afford advice
and information, which he afterwards manifested
in the letter to Miralles above mentioned.</p>

<p class='c013'>In that letter, referring to the capture of Fort
Bute and Baton Rouge, he says: “I am happy
of the opportunity of congratulating you on the
important success of His Majesty’s arms.” It is
hardly probable, however, that General Washington
would have been so ready to congratulate
Miralles on those successes, had he known
that in consequence of Galvez’s bad faith, their
result would be to increase the ranks of the foe
he was fighting.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the beginning of March, 1780, Galvez
again began military operations, by advancing
against Fort Charlotte. On the twelfth, after
his demand for a surrender had been refused by
Captain Durnford, the British commander, the
fort was assailed by six batteries.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the fourteenth, after a conflict of ten days,
a practicable breach having been made, Durnford
capitulated upon the same terms which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Dickson had exacted at Baton Rouge. Hunger
had conspired with arms to make capitulation
a necessity. For several days before that event
the garrison had been comparatively without
food. When the gallant Durnford marched out
of the breach at the head of a handful of hunger-smitten
men, Galvez is said to have manifested
deep mortification at having granted such
favorable terms to so feeble a foe. An effort
was made by General Campbell to relieve Fort
Charlotte, but it fell just as succor was at hand.
The delay in rendering it was occasioned by
rain storms, which, having flooded the country,
greatly impeded the movements of the relieving
force.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c014'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The gallant defense of Fort Charlotte by Durnford
seems to have lead Galvez to reflections
which ended in the conclusion that he was not,
then, strong enough to attack Pensacola. He,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>accordingly, made no further movement, until
he had procured from Havana a supply of
heavy artillery, and a large additional force.</p>

<p class='c013'>That it was a part of his plan to advance
upon Pensacola immediately after the capture
of Mobile, is evidenced by the Spanish Admiral
Solana’s fleet appearing, and anchoring off the
harbor, on March 27, hovering about as if in
expectation of a signal from the land until the
thirtieth, and then sailing away. The appearance
of a scouting party of Spaniards about the same
time, on the east side of the Perdido, likewise
pointed to such a design.</p>

<p class='c013'>Be that as it may, Galvez made no further
movement in West Florida until February, 1781,
the eventful year of the great American rally; the
year that witnessed Morgan’s brilliant victory,
on the seventeenth of January at the Cowpens;
and Green’s masterly strategy, culminating on
the fifteenth of March at Guildford Court
House in an apparent defeat, but in sequence, a
victory, for it sent Cornwallis to Yorktown for
capture on the nineteenth of October.</p>

<p class='c013'>As we contemplate that year, big with the
fate of empire on this continent, the imagination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>is captivated by the spectacle of a line of
battle extending from the northern limits of
Maine to the mouth of the Mississippi; the intense
points of action being Cowpens, Guildford
Court House, Pensacola and Yorktown.</p>

<p class='c013'>That no reinforcement was sent to General
Campbell, although the fall of Fort Charlotte
was a warning that Galvez’s next effort would
be against Pensacola, manifests the strain
which Britain’s contest with her colonies and
France had brought upon both her naval and
military resources. When, therefore, in February,
1781, Galvez was about to advance against
the place with a large fleet and an army of 15,000
men, according to the lowest estimate, the
British force numbered about 1,000<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a> regular
troops, besides some provincials.</p>

<p class='c013'>The British looked for some aid from the
Creek, Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians. It
was a body of the latter which drove the Spanish
scouts across the Perdido shortly after the
capture of Mobile.</p>

<p class='c013'>The three tribes were loyal to their white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>allies, even when the latter were no longer able
to furnish them with their customary supplies.
The Spaniards, on the other hand, with everything
to offer them, utterly failed to shake their
British loyalty. As illustrative of their devotion,
it is related when the Waldecks landed at
Pensacola, the Indians, inferring from their
strange language that they were enemies, inclined
to attack them. They had the prudence,
however, to call upon Governor Chester for an
explanation. After he had satisfactorily answered
the question “whether the men of
strange speech were the friends or foes of their
Great White Brother on the other side of the
big water,” they manifested great joy and honored
the strangers with a salute from their
rifles.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, however, the advance on Pensacola by
the Spaniards was abandoned in the spring of
1780, and thence up to the following December
General Campbell found his savage allies rather
an encumbrance than a benefit. That time was
devoted to strengthening Fort George and the
defenses of the harbor, a labor in which no
reward could induce them to assist. The exciting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>occupation of taking Spanish scalps, for
which £3<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a> were paid, however, was one in which
they could render a barbarous service to the
British.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Indians were under the command of a
Marylander, formerly an ensign in the British
army, who, whilst stationed at Pensacola, had
been cashiered for misconduct. He afterwards
went to the Creek Nation, where he married the
daughter of a chief. Though vainly styling himself
General William Augustus Bowles, he was
content to accept restoration to his rank of
ensign as a reward for the service, which, at the
head of his band of Creeks, Choctaws and
Chickasaws, he was expected to render to the
British during Galvez’s operations in West
Florida.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the latter months of 1780, Pensacola and
the garrison of Fort George were on the point
of starvation. All the resources of the British
government seem to have been required for the
great struggle of 1781 on the Atlantic coast,
and Galvez’s conquest had cut off the customary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>supplies from the rich country lying between
Mobile Bay and the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c013'>Field-preacher Stuernagel says in his journal:
“This morning we drank water and ate a piece
of bread with it. At mid-day we had just nothing
to drink but water. Our evening meal consists
of a pipe of tobacco and a glass of water.
A ham was sold for seven dollars. A pound of
tobacco cost four dollars. A pound of coffee
one dollar. The men have long been without
rum. From hard service, and such want, diseases
were more and more engendered.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c014'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>But that state of want was suddenly changed
to superabundance. A British cruiser captured
in the gulf a number of merchant vessels loaded
with supplies, embracing “rum, meal, coffee,
sugar and other welcome provisions,” and another
exclusively with powder.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a> Not long
afterwards a more brilliant, although not as
useful, a prize was captured. It contained
$20,000 in coin, a large collection of silver-plate,
fine wines, “all sorts of utensils for the kitchen
and things of the same kind, being General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Galvez’s outfit and requirements” for his intended
campaign of 1781.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a> Fortune thus
feasted and gilded the victim for the coming
sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having perfected the defenses of Fort George,
General Campbell turned his attention to Red
Cliff, in which, on November 19, he placed a
small garrison of 50 Waldecks, under the command
of Major Pentzel, at the same time providing
it with some heavy artillery, which could
be spared from Fort George.</p>

<p class='c013'>Apparently, tired of waiting for Galvez’s attack,
or presuming from his delay in making a
movement that he had abandoned the intention
of attacking Pensacola, General Campbell sent
an expedition against a Spanish post, on or
near the Mississippi, called French Town by
the British. The force consisted of 100 infantry
of the Sixtieth regiment, and 60 Waldeckers,
besides 300 Indians, commanded by
Colonel Hanxleden, the senior officer of the
Waldecks, and next in command to General
Campbell. It was an unfortunate enterprise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>resulting in the death of the gallant Hanxleden,
as well as other veteran officers and soldiers
who were soon to be greatly needed at Pensacola.
In the retreat, the body of their brave
commander was borne by his men from the field
of battle to a large oak in its vicinity under the
shade of which it was buried. Gratefully did
the Waldecks, on their return to Germany, remember
and record the chivalric conduct of
“the gallant Spaniards who honored fallen
gallantry by enclosing the grave with a railing.”<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c014'><sup>[35]</sup></a>
On January 9 the remnant of the expedition
reached Fort George.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the ninth of March General Campbell’s
impatient waiting for Galvez was brought to
a close. On that day a preconcerted signal of
seven guns from the war-ship <i>Mentor</i> told the
British that the Spaniards were at last approaching
for the final struggle for mastery in
West Florida.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a> By 9 o’clock of the next morning,
thirty-eight Spanish ships, under Admiral
Solana, were lying off the harbor, or landing
troops and artillery. During the night a British
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>vessel glided out of the harbor with dispatches
to the commandant of Jamaica, pleading for
reinforcements, which however were not to be
had, for the movements of de Grasse on the
Atlantic coast required all the attention of the
British navy, whilst Cornwallis and Clinton
had drawn, or were drawing, there every available
man to meet the great American rally.</p>

<p class='c013'>On March 11, the Spaniards opened fire upon
the <i>Mentor</i>, then lying in the harbor, from a
battery on Santa Rosa island. She replied to
the attack until she had received 28 shots from
twenty-four pound guns, when she retired nearer
the town.</p>

<p class='c013'>After this affair there were no further movements
by the Spaniards until the eighteenth,
when a brig and two galleons, taking advantage
of a very favorable wind, sailed past the
batteries defending the mouth of the harbor,
without receiving any perceptible injury. Thinking
they might sail up to the town, and find
cover from some structures on the beach, General
Campbell caused them to be burned down.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the nineteenth, the entire Spanish fleet,
excepting a few vessels, sailed past the batteries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>though subjected to a heavy fire from Red
Cliff, which lasted for two hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>Galvez, even after he found himself in possession
of the harbor with a fleet of 38 vessels, and
a large land force, consisting not only of troops
brought directly from Havana, but those also
with which he had captured the posts west of
the Perdido, sent to Havana for reinforcements;
and remained inactive until they reached him
on April 16. The reinforcement consisted of
eighteen more ships, and an additional land
force, with heavy siege artillery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whilst awaiting that addition to his strength,
a landing was attempted. The attempt was resisted
by a body of Indians and a part of the
garrison of Fort George with two field pieces
of artillery. The Spaniards, taken by surprise,
were driven to their boats. In the attack many
were killed, and in the confusion of re-embarking
others were drowned. On April 22, however,
a second and successful attempt to land was
made by the invaders, followed by the establishment
of camps where batteries were to be
erected.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the camps, nearer the Fort and the town
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>than the others, by its temerity invited rebuke.
Accordingly, a surprise for it, to be executed on
the twenty-third, was prepared, but defeated by
a fanatic. On the night of the twenty-second,
a Waldeck private reported to his captain, that
a Waldeck corporal was missing, under circumstances
which implied desertion; that the deserter
was a Catholic, the only one in the regiment,
the rest being Protestant; and that it had
been suspected by his comrades that his fanaticism
would lead him, on the first opportunity,
to desert to his co-religionists. That the suspicion
was well founded was manifested by the
movements of the enemy the next morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>The enterprise, however, though arrested, was
not abandoned. The British commander, shrewdly
calculating on the improbability in the enemy’s
conception, that a surprise defeated on the
twenty-third would be attempted on the twenty
fifth, actually executed the movement on the latter
day. The attacking force, composed of a part
of the garrison, and a body of Indians, was commanded
by the general in person. The Spaniards
were driven from their entrenchments with
considerable loss, and their works hastily destroyed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>This proved, however, the last aggressive
act of the British. By the twenty-seventh
of April, batteries mounted with heavy
siege artillery completely invested Fort George.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the twenty-fourth, the day before the attack
on the Spaniards, General Campbell learned
for the first time, that Charleston had been captured
by General Clinton on the eleventh of May,
1780. We are not informed of the channel through
which the information came to him; but as it
could not have come by sea, it must have reached
him through the Indians, who obtained it, probably,
from traders of the Atlantic coast. His
ignorance for nearly a year of so important an
event impresses us with his isolation, and the
courage with which he bore it. The event was
duly celebrated in Fort George by an illumination
and a discharge of rockets.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Fort San Bernardo—Siege of Fort George—Explosion of
Magazine—The Capitulation—The March Through the
Breach—British Troops Sail from Pensacola to Brooklyn.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Spanish operations against Fort George
were conducted with extreme caution. What,
in the beginning, was one of a circle of intrenchments,
developed into a fort as extensive and
strong as the former. Like Fort George, it was
built of earth and timber. Its position was
about one-third of a mile to the northward
of the latter. During its construction it was
hidden from observation by a dense pine forest
and undergrowth, which, after its completion,
were cleared to give play to its guns. It was
named San Bernardo, for the patron saint of
the Spanish commander.</p>

<p class='c013'>The magnitude of San Bernardo indicated
that it must have been constructed for exigencies
besides that of assailing the British works.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Galvez probably feared an attack in his rear
from the Indians coming to the relief of their
allies, or that he might have to encounter a
relieving expedition coming by sea. In either
event his fortress would be a place of security
for his supplies and a rallying point in case of
disaster.</p>

<p class='c013'>The siege was a struggle between two forts,
with the advantage to one of them in being
supported by intrenchments which with itself
formed a circle around its antagonist. The
latter began the contest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the works constructed by the British
to strengthen their position, was a redoubt,
named Waldeck. On April 27, a Spanish intrenchment
was seen to be in the course of construction
opposite to Waldeck, under cover of
the woods. Against that intrenchment the besieged
directed a heavy fire, but with little effect,
as the work was nearly completed when discovered.
This attack upon the besiegers was the
signal for all their batteries to open fire upon
Fort George and its defenses.</p>

<p class='c013'>The firing was incessant on both sides until
May 1, when that of the British was almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>entirely suspended, for the purpose of enabling
the garrison to make some indispensable repairs
on their works. On the second, however, the
British guns were again in full play.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the demand for repairs was so continuous
and urgent as to impose a heavy tax upon
the limited numbers of the besieged. Short reliefs
from duty became a stern necessity, and
want of rest, as well as overexertion, so impaired
their strength that men were seen falling
prostrate beside their guns from fatigue
and exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Galvez’s failure to storm the British works,
during the silence of their guns on May 1,
seemed to indicate his determination to reduce
the contest to the question, how long the ammunition
of the besieged would last and their
artillery remain serviceable? He may, however,
have regarded the suspension of the British
firing as a strategem to invite an assault.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a vital spot in the defenses for
which the Spanish shot and shell had been
vainly seeking—the powder magazine. But as
the gunners were without requisite information
to enable them to procure its range, it was but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>a wild chance that a shell would strike it. That
its position was not drawn from the Waldeck
corporal, is an impeachment of the military
sagacity of the Spanish officers, and an act of
gross negligence which would have prolonged
the siege indefinitely, but for an imprudence of
the British commander equally as gross.</p>

<p class='c013'>A provincial colonel for infamous conduct—of
what character we are uninformed—was drummed
out of the Fort, instead of being, as
prudence required, carefully kept within it during
the siege. The man, as should have been
expected, went to the Spaniards and informed
them of the condition of the garrison and defenses,
and especially of the angle in which the
magazine was situated. That disclosure sealed
the fate of Fort George. Thenceforward, that
angle became the mark of every Spanish shot
and shell. For three days and nights did those
searching missiles beat upon it, until at last on
the morning of May 8, there occurred an explosion
that shook Gage Hill to its deep foundations
as though once again in the throes of
an earthquake.</p>

<p class='c013'>A yawning breach was made in the Fort.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Fifty men were killed outright and as many
more wounded fatally and otherwise.</p>

<p class='c013'>At that thunder-like signal 15,000 men are
marshalled for the assault. But there is no
panic in Fort George. Calmly the British commander
orders every gun to be charged, and
many to be moved so as to sweep the breach.
That work done, he hoists a white flag and
sends an officer under another to the Spanish
general with a communication, which doubtless
had been prepared in anticipation of the conjuncture
in which he at last found himself. It was
an offer to capitulate upon the following terms:
“The troops to march out at the breach with
flying colors and drums beating, each man with
six cartridges in his cartridge box; at the distance
of 500 paces the arms were to be stacked;
the officers to retain their swords; all the
troops to be shipped as soon as possible, at the
cost of the Spaniards to a British port, to be
designated by the British commander, under
parole not to serve against Spain or her <em>allies</em>,
until an equal number of the same rank of
Spaniards, or the troops of her allies, were exchanged
by Great Britain, and the best care to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>be taken of the sick and wounded remaining
behind, who were to be forwarded as soon as
they recovered.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Knowing that those were the terms which
the gallant Dickson and Durnford had demanded
and obtained at Baton Rouge and Mobile,
the spirit in which General Campbell dictated
the terms of the capitulation can be readily imagined.
To submit to less than had been conceded
to his inferior officers would be dishonor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Galvez answered, that the terms proposed
could not be conceded without modification.
General Campbell replied that no modification
was permissible; adding, that in case they were
not conceded he would hold “the Fort to the
last man.” That bold reply was followed by
the consent of Galvez to the capitulation proposed
by the British commander.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be a grateful task to record humanity
or chivalry as the motive for the concession;
and it would be the duty of history to assign it,
in the absence of facts, inconsistent with such a
conclusion. But the victor, by his own confession,
has precluded such a presumption.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a> In a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>letter of General Washington’s to Don Francisco
Rendon, agent of the Spanish government in
the United States, written at “Headquarters
before Yorktown, twelfth of October, 1781,”
occurs the following: “I am obliged by the
extract of General Galvez’s letter to Count de
Grasse, explaining at large <em>the necessity</em> he was
under of granting the terms of capitulation to
the garrison at Pensacola, which the commandant
<em>required</em>. I have no doubt, from General
Galvez’s well known attachment to the cause
of America, that he would have refused the articles,
which have been deemed exceptionable,
had there not been very powerful reasons to
induce his acceptance of them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>What, it may be asked, were “those very
powerful reasons?” He had an army at his
command only one thousand less in number
than General Washington had before Yorktown,
when he wrote the letter to Rendon; he
had ample supplies of every description; he was
backed by a powerful fleet; he had selected
for his expedition a time when de Grasse’s
movements on the Atlantic coast required
the presence, in that quarter, of the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>British naval force on this side of the
Atlantic; and hence, we can find no “necessity
he was under of granting terms,” which General
Campbell “required,” unless we find it in
his want of faith in his ability by force of arms,
to compel the British commander to modify his
requirements.</p>

<p class='c013'>In order to fully appreciate the transaction,
it should be borne in mind that there was an
understanding between Galvez and the French
commanders in America, that he should not
grant to British troops that might fall into his
power during his operations in West Florida,
such terms as would enable them to become a
part of the armies operating against the United
States.</p>

<p class='c013'>This understanding Galvez violated at Baton
Rouge and Mobile, and again for the third
time, in conceding the terms demanded by General
Campbell; for the articles bound the garrison
not to serve against Spain and <em>her allies</em>
only, and the United States was not her ally,
but only a sympathizer.</p>

<p class='c013'>To say that the “powerful reasons,” to quote
from General Washington, were not in Fort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>George, would be to accuse Galvez of bad faith
to his French ally, and untruth, as to the existence
of any necessity for his concession to the
British.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such being the conclusions that impartial history
must draw, impressive was the spectacle
presented, on the ninth of May, 1781, upon
that hill now crowned by the monument to the
Confederate dead. In a circle around Fort
George the Spanish army stands in array. The
roll of a drum breaks the stillness, followed by
the sound of mustering in the Fort. Again as
it beats to the fife’s stirring military air, the
British commander, in the dress of a major-general,
sword in hand, emerges from the breach,
followed by his less than eight hundred heroes.
Proudly does the gallant band step the five hundred
paces; then successively come the orders to
halt, fall into line, and stack arms.</p>

<p class='c013'>The scene would have thrilled the heart of
every soldier whose memory is consecrated by
the shaft that springs from that historic hill,
then the centre of a landscape, whence, northward,
the eye could rest on a limitless expanse
of verdure; eastward and westward upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>far-sweeping curves of the shore; southward
upon the glorious mirror of the Bay, with the
hills of Santa Rosa rising out of the blue waters
like snow-clad peaks above the azure of a distant
horizon, and far beyond them upon the
tremulous sky-line of the heaving gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>The formal signing of the articles of capitulation
in the Council Chamber of Fort George,
which occurred on the ninth of May, immediately
before the British marched out, was anticipated
in a former page.</p>

<p class='c013'>On June the fourth the British troops sailed for
Havana, where they arrived on the fourteenth
of the same month; and thence the same vessels
transported them to Brooklyn. A further addition
was made to the strength of the British,
by the garrisons of Baton Rouge and Fort
Charlotte, which after many obstacles, and
several voyages from point to point, finally
reached Brooklyn about the time the Pensacola
troops arrived there. And thus, in consequence
of Galvez’s breach of faith, a force of 1,200 veterans,
with their gallant officers, was added to
the British army.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was doubtless this accession of British
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>strength, at New York, in that rallying year,
when each side required every available man,
that caused de Grasse to complain to the Spanish
government of the capitulation at Pensacola,
and called forth the apology of Galvez
referred to by General Washington in his letter
to Rendon.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Political Aspect of the Capitulation—Treaty of Versailles—English
Exodus—Widow of the White House.</p>

<p class='c012'>The terms of the surrender of Fort George, as
stated in the previous chapter, present the
strictly military side of the capitulation. But
there was also a political aspect to the formal
articles, signed on the ninth of May, by General
Campbell, Governor Chester, and General Galvez.
West Florida was surrendered to Spain,
and it was stipulated, that “the British inhabitants,
or those who may have been subjects of
the King of Great Britain in said countries,
may retire in full security, and may sell their
estates, and remove their effects as well as their
persons; the time limited for their emigration
being fixed at the space of eighteen months.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was that political feature of the capitulation
which made Governor Chester’s signature
necessary, and to that it related exclusively.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>That of General Campbell referred to the strictly
military stipulations only. In the former we
may find one of General Galvez’s inducements
to submit to the British general’s “requirements.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The object of the Spanish government in directing
the invasion of West Florida was to permanently
regain the territory which Spain had
surrendered to Great Britain in 1763; and in
addition, to obtain that part of Louisiana on
the Gulf of Mexico which the latter had acquired
from France. Consequently, the large expedition
so long in preparing against Pensacola, and so
disproportionate to the mere capture of the
place, was intended for colonization, as well as
conquest. Such being the policy of his government,
Galvez necessarily subordinated all other
considerations to its achievement. Accordingly,
his overwhelming numbers designed to overawe
opposition; his ponderous siege artillery
intended to batter Fort George into ruins without
danger to the town; avoidance of all movements
by his fleet against it as well as all injury
to it by his artillery during the siege; and, lastly,
the article above quoted pointed to the colonization
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of a Spanish population, for the accommodation
of which the English homes were to be
vacated, and their inmates forced into exile. If
that object could be obtained by the capitulation,
there was nothing within the lines of Spanish
policy to be gained by taking Fort George
by storm, at the fearful sacrifice of human life
which it would have cost. The French might,
indeed, complain that the agreement with them
respecting British troops in Florida was violated
by conceding the terms demanded by
General Campbell; but diplomacy, the science of
excuses and pretexts, would be equal to the task
of satisfying them. As to the Americans, it was of
little consequence to Spain that General Clinton’s
forces would be strengthened by the reinforcement
of the Florida troops, albeit at a conjuncture
when every available man was required
to sustain Britain’s tottering North American
empire. For though Spain became an ally of
France in order to place herself in a position to
claim a fragment of that empire when it fell, yet
her purpose was to attain that end with the
least possible inconvenience or sacrifice to herself.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>That General Washington was satisfied with
the apology of Galvez made through de Grasse
may well be doubted. His dignity, however,
forbade complaint. Besides, the promise violated
was made to the French; if they were satisfied,
respect for them imposed silence upon the Americans.
But there is in the paragraph of the letter
to Rendon, before quoted, a vein of irony, the
sting of which, coming from such a man, Galvez
must have keenly felt.</p>

<p class='c013'>As already intimated, the above quoted provision
of the capitulation became substantially
the Fifth Article of the treaty between Great
Britain and Spain, signed on the twenty-eighth
of January, 1783, at Versailles.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The condition in which that treaty placed the
Florida-English was peculiar. Spain was not
opposed to foreigners living in her colonies, provided
they were Catholics; and it was well understood,
that any English who were, or should
become, such would be at liberty to remain in
Florida in the full enjoyment of their liberty
and property.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>History does not afford a more striking contrast
between the conduct of two nations under
similar circumstances, to the honor of one, and
the reproach of the other, than that between
Spain and Great Britain, as they are presented
by the treaties of Paris and Versailles. In the
former, Spanish subjects were secured in their
persons, religion, liberty and property. In the
latter, Great Britain virtually stipulated for the
banishment of hers, and the confiscation of their
estates. The privilege of selling their property
within eighteen months was but a mockery; for
purchasers were not only few, but well aware,
likewise, that a trifling consideration would in
the end be preferable to a total sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c013'>The British government professed to compensate
the victims of her policy; but her justice
was confined to those whose claims upon it
were the slightest; to the absentees owning
large tracts of land which had been granted by
the crown, and who did not see fit to go to the
provinces to attempt to effect sales. <a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a>But no
indemnity was provided for those who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>made their homes in the provinces, under
the gilded representations and inviting promises
of their governors in the name of His Protestant
Majesty, George III., Defender of the Faith.</p>

<p class='c013'>The conduct of Spain in this matter is hardly
censurable, when it is remembered that it occurred
in an age of religious intolerance. She was
a Catholic power and wanted no Protestant
subjects. Her own had left Florida in 1763, as
soon as the Spanish flag was lowered. In the
articles of capitulation and the treaty of 1783
she had enforced her traditional policy. And
to her credit, be it said, that she did not enforce
banishment and confiscation after eighteen
months had expired under the former; and when
that period had elapsed under the latter, she
granted an extension of four months. Great
Britain, on the other hand, in yielding to Spain’s
demands was false to her faith, false to her traditions,
and false to that boasted principle of
her constitution that her ægis covers every
Englishman, in every land.</p>

<p class='c013'>Eighteen months is but a fleeting span to a
people, when it is but a respite from confiscation
and exile, avoidable only by apostasy.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Of the heartaches of the exodus of the Florida-English
we have an illustration in the widow
of the White House. She had lived out the
eighteen months under the capitulation, and
the like period under the treaty, when the extension
came to her like a respite to the condemned.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those four months embraced the days and
nights of her struggle in the toils of temptation,
foreshadowed in a previous page. Can she leave
that home, consecrated by the graves of her husband
and her child; that home where every object,
tree, vine, shrub, sea, sky, and the very
wild violets at her feet, brought up hallowed associations
and sacred memories which made them
all parts of her very being? No! The surrender
would be at the cost of as many bleeding heart
strings. There is, however, an escape in apostasy.
She has but to signify her wish to renounce
her faith; that faith, however, with which
she had consoled a dying husband, and in which
she had buried a darling child. Home triumphs.
The governor is notified.</p>

<p class='c013'>Time wanes to the day of sacrifice. The bell
tolls the sacrificial hour. The priest stands at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the altar ready for the offering. But the victim
fails the tryst. Faith triumphs. The bonds
of temptation are snapped. Turning her back
upon home, she goes forth an exile; crowned,
we may well believe, with the promise to all the
true of every creed who leave “lands” and
“houses” for His name’s sake, to swell the
mighty host of woman martyrs; time’s woeful
harvest of blighted lives and broken hearts;
victims of man’s ambitions, his wars, his policies,
and his laws.</p>

<p class='c011'>Boundary Lines—William Panton and Spain—Indian Trade—Indian
Ponies and Traders—Business of Panton,
Leslie &amp; Co.</p>

<p class='c012'>The treaty of Versailles re-adjusted the broken
circle of Spain’s empire on the shores of the
Gulf of Mexico, by restoring to it the segment
taken from it by d’Iberville’s settlement, as well
as that cut from it by the Treaty of Paris in
1763.</p>

<p class='c013'>But British West Florida was not in its entirety
acquired by Spain. By the Treaty of Paris
of the third day of September, 1783, acknowledging
the independence of the United States,
the 31° parallel of north latitude was made the
southern limit of the latter from the Mississippi
river to the Appalachicola. Thence the boundary
line was that river up to the Flint, thence in a
straight line to the head waters of the St. Mary’s
and down that river to the Atlantic ocean. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Treaty of Versailles, on the other hand, made
that line the northern boundary of the territory
ceded to Spain. Those treaties therefore cut off
a huge slice from British West Florida.</p>

<p class='c013'>But, even within that narrow strip of territory,
Pensacola lost its primacy; for in the establishment
of the Spanish colonial governments
within it, the Perdido was made the western
limit of West Florida. Pensacola was, therefore,
by that arrangement placed geographically
in reference to boundary lines as it stands
to-day; the result, as before shown, of d’Arriola
having made his settlement three years before
the advent of d’Iberville to the gulf coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those territorial changes dealt a withering
blow to Pensacola. Instead of being the capital
of a province, bounded by the Mississippi and
the Chattahoochee, and a line from one to the
other some miles north of Montgomery, it became
but the chief town of a narrow strip of
wilderness between the Perdido and the Appalachicola
rivers. Lately regarded and fostered as
the future commercial base on the gulf of Britain’s
North American empire, it now became a
garrison town, valued by Spain as only an outpost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>to guard against encroachments by other
powers on the shores of a sea over which she
sought supremacy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Left to Spanish influences exclusively, it must
have rapidly dwindled to the condition, commercially
at least, in which Captain Wills found
it in 1763. But from that fate it was saved
by two men who have already been introduced
to the reader.</p>

<p class='c013'>The narrow religious prejudices of the Spanish
court demanded the banishment of all Protestant
British under the Fifth Article of the Treaty
of Versailles; and they were rigidly obeyed by
colonial officials with one exception. They knew
that to banish William Panton was to insure
for the town the fate above indicated, and they
were equally aware that his presence would be
more effective in the preservation of the peace of
the provinces than a large military force, owing
to his influence over Alexander McGillivray, and
of the latter’s over the powerful Creek Indians.
Indeed, it is unquestionable, that without those
influences, the Spanish government could not
have been maintained in West Florida. But it
would have been idle to hope that a man who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>had been loyal to an earthly monarch, under
pain of confiscation and banishment, would incur
the guilt of apostasy from a faith that was
to him, at least, the symbol of allegiance to the
King of Kings. Accordingly, the religious test
was waived as to him, and for it was substituted
an oath of allegiance to the Spanish King, whilst
his residence and influence were secured by means
the most inviting to his interest and flattering
to his pride.</p>

<p class='c013'>A treaty was entered into with him, as a
quasi-sovereign, securing his firm in all its possessions
and rights, and bestowing upon its
houses at Pensacola, Mobile and Appalachee a
monopoly of the Indian trade. For these concessions
the firm became the financial agent of
the government at those points, and bound to
wield its influence in promoting peace and good
will between the Spaniards and the Indians.</p>

<p class='c013'>The stipulations on both sides were faithfully
fulfilled. At one time Spain was indebted to the
firm in the sum of $200,000 for advances, and
the debt was afterwards faithfully discharged.
In humiliating contrast with the honor and
fidelity which marked the dealings of the Scotchmen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>and Spaniards with each other, is the following
advice of an American agent, James Seagraves,
<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c014'><sup>[41]</sup></a>to his government. “I think if the
Spanish court were pushed in the business they
will readily sacrifice Panton &amp; Co., especially
as they owe the concern $200,000 for Indian
supplies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This advice was given at a time when complications
had arisen between the Spanish government
of Florida and the United States, growing
out of the energetic struggle of the Atlantic
Indian traders to divert the Creek trade from
Pensacola to Charleston and Savannah. The
step suggested was, in effect, to transfer a commercial
contest from the Indian wilds to Madrid,
where an American minister was expected
to perform the degrading task of attempting to
induce the Spanish court to commit a fraud
upon agents who had served it so long and
faithfully, as well as to violate all its other
obligations to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Panton, Leslie &amp; Co. were engaged in that
trade at Charleston and Savannah long before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the American revolution; a trade which, even
then, extended through the Coosa country in
the heart of the Creek nation. With a full knowledge
of it, in all its details, they established
themselves at Pensacola with a view of drawing
a part of it there. This was the beginning
of the commercial struggle which is continued
to this day, between the gulf and Atlantic ports
for the trade of Central Alabama. It began
with the Indian ponies as a means of transportation;
it is carried on now by the steam horse;
and a future generation may see it continued by
electricity.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pony used by the trader was a strong,
hardy little creature, which with ease carried
one hundred and eighty pounds and traveled
twenty-five miles a day. The rich and abundant
pasturage in those times enabled him to
supply himself with sufficient food at noon and
at night to meet his requirements. There was
often oddity in his load. It might be a miniature
chickenhouse, or two kegs of taffi, hung to
his sides, with a pack of merchandise on his
back; or two pendant firkins of honey-comb,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>with a pile of hides, skins, or beeswax towering
between.</p>

<p class='c013'>One driver for ten animals was the usual proportion
of man and beast. The companies were
generally from five to ten, making a long line of
march, following the main and lateral trails
mentioned in a previous chapter. But as all
the Indian settlements were visited, their movements
could not always be on the ridge. Sometimes
creeks and rivers had to be crossed. On
such occasions, when the stream was not fordable
with safety to the packs, they were ferried
over on rafts composed of logs or masses of
matted cane, guided where the current was
strong by a grapevine rope stretched across the
stream.</p>

<p class='c013'>Regarded by their savage customers as friends,
who came periodically to administer to their
wants, and gratify their taste for taffi, the
traders made their journeys in perfect security.
Like their class everywhere, they were joyous
men, full of fun and jokes, news and gossip, to
which full play was given, under the spur of a
cup of taffi, when caravans met.</p>

<p class='c013'>Beside the trade thus carried on, there was one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>equally as great, if not greater, carried on by the
Indians themselves, without the intervention of
the traders. The business required Panton,
Leslie &amp; Co. to keep up a stock of $50,000 at
least, and a large corps of clerks to wait on
their savage customers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other business sprung up and brought population.
Sawmills were erected, brickyards opened
and a tanyard established, which added leather
to the exports of the town.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such were the fruits of William Panton’s presence
in the province. Idle, however, would have
been his labor, his wealth and talents, though
backed by the Spanish Government, but for the
co-operation of McGillivray. Had the great
Chief pointed his long, slender finger to Savannah
and Charleston as the sources of supply for
his people, the commercial life of Pensacola
would have withered and perished like a tree
girdled by the woodman’s axe.</p>

<p class='c012'>The people who have been called Creeks in
previous pages, received that name after their
settlement in Alabama and Georgia; a name, it
is said, they derived from the number and
beauty of the streams or creeks of the country
they inhabited. Before that they were known
as Muscogees according to English, and Othomis
or Otomies, according to Castilian orthography.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their original seat was in northern Mexico.
They were a warlike and independent tribe,
which, though lacking the comparative civilization
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>of the Aztecs and the Tlascalans, had yet
received some rays of its light. They had been
confederates of the latter in their conflicts for
existence with the former. They had afterwards
aided in the defence of Tlascala against Cortez.
Surviving warriors, however, carried back to
their people such accounts of that field of
slaughter, and the prowess of the foe, who seemed
to be armed with supernatural weapons,
that the tribe became panic-stricken, and in a
council, resolved upon a flight beyond the reach
of the invincible invader. The determination
was promptly put into execution.</p>

<p class='c013'>The entire tribe, bearing off its movable effects,
took its line of march in an easterly course.
After a journey which consumed many months,
they found themselves on the head waters of
Red river. Reaching that river, and following
it, they at length found a suitable place for a
settlement, where they felt they were sufficiently
remote from the terrible foe who had inspired
their flight. There they accordingly established
themselves, and remained for several years.
Abandoning that settlement, they proceeded
northward to the Missouri, thence to the Mississippi,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>and from there moved to the Ohio. That
progress, however, was not by a continuous
march, but by periodic advances, interrupted
by settlements more or less long, and marked
by conflicts with other tribes, in which, according
to their traditions, they were always victorious.</p>

<p class='c013'>They must have been living on the banks of
the Ohio, when Soto made his devastating march
through the Creek country which was afterwards
to be their home. There they must have
been likewise, when de Luna made his explorations,
and noted the sparseness of population,
and abandoned fields as before narrated; or,
perhaps, they were then making one of their intermittent
advances southward, which were to
bring them eventually to the Coosa, Tallapoosa,
and Chattahoochee.</p>

<p class='c013'>Like other Mexican tribes, the Muscogees
were divided into septs or fratries, the most
notable of them being those of the Ho-tal-gee,
or the Wind, the Tiger, the Bear, and the Eagle.
In the first, however, resided the primacy, or
hegemony of the tribe.</p>

<p class='c013'>The traditions of their Mexican origin and emigration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>collected by Le Clerc Milfort under the
most favorable conditions, as will be seen hereafter,
are fortified by their form of government,
with its dual executive for civil and military
affairs; their glimmer of civilization, as well as
their federative tendency.</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon after their settlement in the Creek
country, they are found absorbing other tribes;
not by enslavement or incorporation, but as
confederates. They had their national councils,
composed of the principal chiefs of the confederacy,
and suitable buildings at fixed places for
their accommodation. The head of the confederacy
for civil affairs was the Grand Chief, as the
Tustenuggee, or Great Warrior, was for war.
They also had Town Governments, the Chief of
each being the Micco, an elective officer, and not
a King, as often misrepresented. Each town
had its council house, in which local affairs were
administered.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Grand Chief of the Muscogees held the
position, and exercised the functions which
recent criticism has assigned to Montezuma, as
the head of the Aztec confederacy, to whom the
Spaniards erroneously gave the title, and attributed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the powers of an emperor, in accordance
with their own habits of thought, as the subjects
of an emperor.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Indian trade that existed between the
Creeks and the Atlantic coast, which has
already been mentioned, was an inviting field
to cupidity and enterprise, and many were the
young adventurers from the old world who engaged
in it soon after their landing at Charleston
or Savannah. Some of them, too, fascinated
by the wild life of the forest, made themselves
homes in the Creek nation, and found
wives amongst the Creek maidens, who in form,
feature and habits, were superior to those of
other tribes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Amongst those adventurous spirits was
Lachlan McGillivray, a youth of good Scotch
family, of Dumglass, Scotland. A few years
found him a successful trader. On one of his
visits to the Hickory Ground, a prominent
Creek town on the Coosa, situated near the
present site of Wetumpka, Alabama, he became
acquainted with Sehoy Marchand, a young
woman whose mother was a full blood of the Ho-tal-gee,
or Wind family, and whose father was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>French captain who had been murdered by mutineers
at Fort Toulouse, a few miles from Hickory
Ground. That meeting resulted in marriage.
Shortly afterward, McGillivray made a home,
and established a trading house, not far from
where he had first met his Indian wife.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of that marriage, Alexander McGillivray was
the first born, Sophia the next, and Jenette the
third.</p>

<p class='c013'>The father became exceedingly prosperous,
partly in consequence of his alliance with the
chief family of the Creeks, and in a few years
found himself the owner of two plantations on
the Savannah river. His trading journeys,
however, still had their attractions for him.
When Alexander was fourteen years old he induced
his wife to let the boy go with him to
Charleston, and remain there to be educated.
After having been instructed sufficiently for the
purpose, he was placed in a counting-house;
but having acquired a taste for learning, that
occupation became intolerable to him. His
father, accordingly, determined to yield to the
bent of the boy’s mind, and found him a highly
educated teacher in a clergyman of Charleston.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>With that assistance, and sedulous application,
he became a Greek and Latin scholar, and
besides, made rapid and extensive progress in
other departments of knowledge. He appears
to have been a student up to the age of thirty,
which he reached about the year 1776. In that
year he left Charleston, an educated man, to
return to his people, whom he, a little semi-savage
of fourteen, had left sixteen years before.
The impelling motive to that movement probably
was, that being like his father, a loyalist,
residence in a rebel colony was no longer agreeable.
Possibly, however, he had purposely
deferred his return to the Indian nation until
he had arrived at such an age as would justify
him in looking to the position of Grand Chief.
But, be that as it may, the time for his return
was judiciously chosen, and consistently with
that sagacity which characterized his whole life,
of acting opportunely in all exigencies.</p>

<p class='c013'>The white settlers of Georgia were beginning to
press through what the Creeks claimed as their
frontier; and to that pressure was added the
hostility engendered by the revolution, now in its
second year, against any semblance of favor to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>the enemies of the patriotic cause. The West
Florida-English and their government were on
the most friendly terms with the Creeks; and
that in itself was sufficient to beget hostility to
the latter on the part of the Whigs of Georgia
and the Carolinas. This was a new and complex
condition of things to the Creeks, presenting
questions for solution with which their
great council felt its inability to deal. To
whom could they look for guidance? They
knew no disinterested advice could come from
the government at Pensacola, and it would be
folly to seek counsel from the Georgians, who
regarded them as enemies because they desired
to be neutrals, living in peace between hostile
communities, engaged in a conflict in which the
Indian could feel no interest.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was just at this juncture that Alexander
McGillivray found himself amongst his people.
Long and impatiently had they awaited the
advent of the representative of the Ho-tal-gee,
the grand chieftain, who for so many years had
been studying that wisdom of the white man,
which made him the Indian’s superior; that
wisdom which now acquired by him, was to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>exercised for the salvation of his people. Great,
therefore, was the satisfaction produced the
advent of such a disinterested counselor and
guide.</p>

<p class='c013'>He is hardly well within the nation before a
grand council is called at Coweta, on the Chattahoochee,
over which he was to preside, and
formally assume the hegemony of the Ho-tal-gee.</p>

<p class='c013'>To a thoughtful mind there is a pathos in
this scene which appeals to every generous
nature! It comes like the despairing appeal of
infancy to manhood for help! It is the ignorance
of the savage stretching out its supplicating
hands to the white man’s wisdom as his
only refuge.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most striking powers which McGillivray
possessed, was his ability to win and
retain the childlike confidence of his people, and
thereby exercise boundless control over them.
He was not a soldier, or a man of blood, in any
sense of the term. He was essentially a statesman
and a diplomat. The conquests of peace
only had any fascination for him. His ambition
was to save and civilize his people. That such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>a man should bend to his will in the paths of
peace a numerous population of warlike savages,
to whom the war-whoop was music, and
scalping the most inviting pastime, is a domination
over brute instincts of which history
contains very few examples.</p>

<p class='c013'>A remarkable instance of that influence occurred
shortly after the council at Coweta. He
there made the acquaintance of Le Clerc Milfort,
mentioned in a previous page; an adventurous
Frenchman, highly educated, and possessing
military qualities of no ordinary kind, as well
as bodily strength and endurance equal to any
exertion. Their mental culture was a mutual
attraction.</p>

<p class='c013'>Milfort went with him from Coweta to Hickory
Ground, the home of McGillivray’s childhood,
where his mother and his sisters Sophia
and Jenette were living. He at once entered
into Creek life, and united his fortunes with
McGillivray’s. The bright eyes of Jenette
were not long in winning Milfort’s heart, nor
was there much delay in his winning hers. They
were married. By the marriage he acquired
great consideration amongst the Creeks.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>As previously remarked, McGillivray was not
a soldier himself; but as a wise ruler, he felt the
necessity of having an able commander in war,
when the exigency for it arose. Moreover, his
policy as a civilized ruler, was to have war conducted
by a civilized leader, who might by his
example and influence, control the brutal
instincts of his savage forces. Milfort was the
man for the place. An obstacle to his appointment,
seemingly insuperable, however, existed.
The office of Tustenuggee was an honor to
which the Indian braves looked as the highest
attainable; and presumptively, they would refuse
their consent that this coveted prize should
be conferred upon a stranger. But, that stranger
had married a Ho-tal-gee, and it was the wish of
the Grand Chief that he should receive it. It
was, accordingly, conferred upon Milfort with
the sanction of the tribe.</p>

<p class='c013'>McGillivray soon attracted the attention of the
British government at Pensacola, as well as that
of the British officers in Georgia, with whom he
carried on an extensive correspondence. They
at once saw that it would be impossible for
him to keep the Creeks in a state of neutrality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>founded, as it must be, upon good feeling for
each of two bitter foes, marked by such strict
impartiality of conduct as to avoid any ground
of exception by either belligerent. McGillivray’s
judgment soon led him to the same conclusion;
a conclusion which imposed upon him the necessity
of choosing one of the belligerents for the
ally of his people. He, accordingly, decided in
favor of a British alliance, for which the reasons
were too obvious for hesitation.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Americans could reach his people upon
one frontier only, and even then their attention
would be distracted by their contest with the
British. The British, on the other hand, could
without danger of interference, assail the Creeks
from Pensacola; and in case they crushed, the
Georgians would be at liberty to attack them
from the east. But, although he sided with the
British, it was with the secret resolution that
the alliance should be maintained at the least
possible sacrifice to his people. His policy was,
not to permit their spirit to be broken, or their
numbers diminished, by entering with their full
strength into a conflict with which they had
no concern. Nor would he permit them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>inflict such extensive injuries upon Georgia as
would be a barrier to future reconciliation.</p>

<p class='c013'>In order to spur the Creeks to great efforts
against the Americans, Tait, a British colonel,
was stationed on the Coosa; and at the same
time McGillivray received from the British government
the commission and pay of colonel in
its service. But both expedients proved ineffectual
to materially change the policy the latter
had adopted. Raids, it is true, were made
upon the Georgians, necessarily attended by
some blood-shed and rapine, but they were limited
in number, character, and consequence, by
the mental reservation with which McGillivray
had entered into the British alliance. With that
limited exertion, however, the British were fain
to be content, as it was better for them than
strict neutrality, and still more so than the hostility
of such a powerful tribe directed against
themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Milfort was the commander intrusted with
the expeditions against the Georgia settlements;
and, doubtless, being fully aware of the conservative
policy of the Grand Chief, he made
every effort to observe it. A Frenchman, of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>ability, was the very man to make such a show
of warfare as would impose on the British, and
at the same time to render it so barren in
results as to make but a transient impression
upon those against whom it was directed.
That a man should have been selected so eminently
qualified to execute such a singular task,
affords the highest evidence of the capacity of
the mind that made the selection. Such ability,
is, indeed, after all, the surest test of the capacity
of a ruler.</p>

<p class='c013'>Though a band of the Creeks, as already mentioned,
assisted the British at the time of Galvez’s
operations against Pensacola, it is remarkable,
that neither McGillivray, who was a
colonel in the British army, nor Milfort, the
Great War Chief, seem to have taken any part
in the contest. Such a force as could have been
raised by the Creeks and their confederate
tribes, could have rendered great service to the
British in resisting, if not, indeed, in defeating
Galvez’s invasion. But an explanation is
readily found in the Grand Chiefs policy of
preventing his people from taking any large
part in the quarrels and conflicts of the whites.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Besides, he was doubtless impressed with the
smallness of the British force in West-Florida,
compared with the host the Spaniards had at
their command; justifying the conclusion, that
as the latter had been able to conquer the country
west, they would prove equal to the conquest
of that east of the Perdido. He, therefore,
wisely refrained from such an interference as
would array the Spaniards against his people,
after they had expelled the British from the
country. If the British proved victorious, the
assistance rendered by the Creeks, aided by the
Choctaws and Chickasaws, could be urged as
the fulfillment of the obligations of an ally.
On the other hand, if the Spaniards were successful,
it was an easy matter to disavow the
action of an adventurer like Bowles, at the head
of a handful of Creeks and other Indians, as
one in which the tribe had no concern; an explanation
the more acceptable, as the conqueror
would naturally seek to cultivate the like
friendly relations with the Indians which the
conquered had enjoyed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon after McGillivray became Grand Chief
of his tribe, he met William Panton at Pensacola.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Panton was deeply impressed with his
ability. It is probable, too, that he was acquainted
with the elder McGillivray, and sympathized
with him as a fellow victim, who, like
himself, had suffered banishment and confiscation,
for no other crime than loyalty to their
King. That sympathy with the parent naturally
inspired good will toward the son. But,
aside from such a sentimental consideration,
each soon discovering the great advantage he
could be to the other, it was not long before
they were united by the more practical bonds
of mutual interests. McGillivray likewise saw
great advantages to his people in dealing exclusively
with a house of such great wealth and
influence as that of Panton, Leslie &amp; Co., whilst
Panton was as quick to see, that by the management
of the Grand Chief the firm could secure
a monopoly of the entire Indian trade. It was
immediately after this understanding between
them was reached, that they had that meeting
with Governor Chester in the Council Chamber
of Fort George, of which a glimpse was had in
a previous page.</p>

<p class='c013'>The war in Georgia and South Carolina had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>cut off the Creek trade with the Atlantic coast;
and consequently, McGillivray had no difficulty
in directing the whole of it to Pensacola. But
after peace was established, the Atlantic traders
were again ready, with their pack ponies, to
take the trails that led to western Georgia
and eastern Alabama. Panton at once saw
that the monopoly of his house was in danger;
and that to avert it, he must bring about an
understanding between the Spanish government,
himself, and McGillivray, like that which
he had previously effected with the British. He,
accordingly, entered into the treaty with the
Spaniards, of which mention was made in the
previous chapter. To be effective, however, he
knew that treaty must be supplemented by
another between the Indians and the Spaniards.</p>

<p class='c013'>In playing his cards, Panton was looking
solely to the advantage of his house. But it
was far otherwise with McGillivray. If he induced
his people to make such a treaty, it was
because he saw clearly it was to their advantage.
He rejoiced, too, to find that he was
about to reap the fruit of that policy by which
he had brought them through the period of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Revolutionary War, stronger, and more numerous
than they ever were before; a condition
which excited the fears of the Spaniards, and
disposed them to seek the alliance of such a
powerful tribe by liberal concessions. Accordingly,
a treaty between the Creeks and the Seminoles
represented by McGillivray, and Spain
by Governor Miro of New Orleans, assisted by
O’Niell, Governor of West-Florida, and Don
Martin Navarro, Intendent General of Florida,
was entered into on the first of June, 1784, at
Pensacola.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c014'><sup>[42]</sup></a> The relations created by that
treaty between the Indians and Spaniards were
close and intimate, and seem to have been
observed substantially, although not always
in form, up to the last day of Spanish rule in
Florida.</p>

<p class='c013'>Its conclusion was followed by McGillivray
obtaining a commission with the pay of Colonel
in the Spanish army.</p>

<p class='c013'>By that treaty he felt, as he had reason to
feel, that he had secured for his tribe an alliance
with a strong European power, one that had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>just expelled the British from the Floridas;
and, that thus fortified, he was in a condition
to meet the Americans on the eastern frontier
in a manner that would prevent their threatened
encroachment upon the rights of his people;
not by war, however, in which the Creeks were
to engage with the United States, for such a
course, his judgment told him, would end in
their destruction. His treaty with the Spaniards
was but a card which he proposed to use,
to give his nation the imposing aspect of one to
be courted rather than despised. To render its
attitude still more imposing, he announced his
determination to prevent any further encroachments
by the whites upon the Indian territory
in Georgia.</p>

<p class='c013'>These cards won the game, according to the
calculations of the sagacious brain which conceived
it. The United States met the threatening
aspect of affairs in Georgia, by appointing
commissioners in 1785, to treat with the
Indians. One of them, Andrew Pickens, addressed
a letter to McGillivray, expressing the
wish of the government amicably “to adjust
matters on an equitable footing.” This was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>the point for the attainment of which the treaty
with the Spaniards, and the threats of hostility
against the Georgians had been made. For it
was the strength of the Creeks, which his policy
had so successfully fostered in the midst of
war, backed by the Spanish alliance, that induced
the United States, exhausted by the Revolutionary
struggle, to resort to peaceable means
to avoid a conflict with such a powerful tribe.</p>

<p class='c013'>The reply of McGillivray so clearly illustrates
his profound policy, which previous pages have
endeavored to unfold as the moving spring of
all his actions as Grand Chief, that it must be
given in extenso, especially as any attempt to
present it by extracts would prove a mutilation
in which its force would be impaired, if not
destroyed.</p>
<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Little Tallasee</span>, 5th Sept., 1785.</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>:—I am favored with your letter by Brandon, who,
after detaining it near a month, sent it by an Indian, a few
days ago. He, perhaps, had some reasons for keeping himself
from this region.</p>

<p class='c016'>The notification you have sent us is agreeable to our
wishes, as the meetings intended for the desirable purpose
of adjusting and settling matters, on an equitable footing,
between the United States and the Indian nations. At the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>same time, I cannot avoid expressing my surprise that a
measure of this nature should have been so long delayed,
on your part. When we found that the American Independence
was confirmed by the peace, we expected that the new
government would soon have taken some steps to make up
the differences that subsisted between them and the Indians
during the war; to have taken them under their protection,
and confirmed to them their hunting-grounds. Such a course
would have reconciled the minds of the Indians and secured
the States their friendship, as they considered your people
their natural allies. The Georgians, whose particular interest
it was to conciliate the friendship of this nation, have
acted, in all respects, to the contrary. I am sorry to
observe that violence and prejudice have taken the place of
good policy and reason, in all their proceedings with us.
They attempted to avail themselves of our supposed distressed
situation. Their talks to us breathe nothing but
vengeance, and, being entirely possessed with the idea, that
we were wholly at their mercy, they never once reflected
that colonies of a powerful monarch were nearly surrounding
us, to whom, in an extremity, we might apply for
succor and protection, and who, to answer some ends of
their policy, might grant it to us. However, we yet deferred
any such proceeding, still expecting that we could bring
them to a true sense of their interest; but still finding no
alteration in their conduct towards us, we sought the protection
of Spain, and treaties of friendship and alliance
were mutually entered into—they guaranteeing our hunting-grounds
and territory, and granting us a free trade in
the ports of the Floridas.</p>

<p class='c016'>How the boundary and limits between the Spaniards and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the States will be determined a little time will show, as I
believe that matter is now on foot. However, we know
our limits, and the extent of our hunting-grounds. As a
free nation, we have applied, as we had the right to do, for
protection, and obtained it. We shall pay no attention to
any limits that may prejudice our claims, that were drawn
by an American and confirmed by a British negotiator.
Yet, notwithstanding we have been obliged to adopt these
measures for our preservation, and from real necessity, we
sincerely wish to have it in our power to be on the same
footing with the States as before the late unhappy war, to
effect which is entirely in your power. We want nothing
from you but justice. We want our hunting-grounds preserved
from encroachments. They have been ours from the
beginning of time, and I trust that, with the assistance of
our friends, we shall be able to maintain them against every
attempt that may be made to take them from us.</p>

<p class='c016'>Finding our representations to the State of Georgia of no
effect, in restraining their encroachments, we thought it
proper to call a meeting of the nation, on the subject. We
then came to the resolution to send our parties to remove
the Georgians and their effects from the lands in question,
in the most peaceful manner possible.</p>

<p class='c016'>Agreeably to your requisition, and to convince you of my
sincere desire to restore a good understanding between us,
I have taken the necessary steps to prevent any future predatory
excursions of my people against any of your settlements.
I could wish the people of Cumberland showed an
equal good disposition to do what is right. They were
certainly the first aggressors, since the peace, and acknowledged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>it in a written certificate, left at the Indian camp
they had plundered.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have only to add, that we shall meet the commissioners
of Congress whenever we shall receive notice, in expectation
that every matter of difference will be settled, with that
liberality and justice worthy the men who have so gloriously
asserted the cause of liberty and independence, and that we
shall, in future, consider them as brethren, and defenders of
the land.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The reader must be induced to read another

<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>as a narrative of events bearing upon his life,
which no pen can so well narrate as his own.
It is in reply to a letter of James White, superintendent
of the Creek Indians.</p>
<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Little Tallasee</span>, 8th April, 1787.</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>:—It is with real satisfaction, that I learn of your
being appointed by Congress, for the laudable purpose of
inquiring into and settling the differences that, at present
subsist between our nation and the Georgians. It may be
necessary for you to know the cause of these differences,
and our discontents, which, perhaps, have never come to
the knowledge of the honorable body that sent you to our
country.</p>

<p class='c016'>There are Chiefs of two towns in this nation, who, during
the late war, were friendly to the State of Georgia, and had
gone, at different times, among those people, and once, after
the general peace, to Augusta. They there demanded of
them a grant of lands, belonging to and enjoyed as hunting-grounds
by the Indians of this nation, in common, on
the east of the Oconee river. The Chiefs rejected the demand,
on the plea, that these lands were the hunting-grounds
of the nation, and could not be granted by two
individuals; but, after a few days, a promise was extorted
from them, that, on their return to our country, they
would use their influence to get a grant confirmed. Upon
their return, a general convention was held at Tookabatcha,
when these two Chiefs were severely censured, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Chiefs of ninety-eight towns agreed upon a talk, to be sent
to Savannah, disapproving, in the strongest manner, of the
demand made upon their nation, and denying the right of
any two of their country to make cession of land, which
could only be valid by the unanimous voice of the whole,
as joint proprietors in common. Yet these two Chiefs, regardless
of the voice of the nation, continued to go to
Augusta, and other places within the State. They received
presents and made promises; but our customs did
not permit us to punish them for the crime. We warned the
Georgians of the dangerous consequences that would
certainly attend the settling of the lands in question. Our
just remonstrances were treated with contempt, and these
lands were soon filled with settlers. The nation, justly
alarmed at the encroachments, resolved to use force to
maintain their rights, yet, being averse to the shedding of
the blood of a people whom we would rather consider as
friends, we made another effort to awaken in them a sense
of justice and equity. But we found, from experience, that
entreaty could not prevail, and parties of warriors were
sent, to drive off the intruders, but were instructed to shed
blood, only, where self-preservation made it necessary.</p>

<p class='c016'>This was in May, 1786. In October following we were
invited by commissioners, of the State of Georgia, to meet
them in conference, at the Oconee, professing a sincere desire
for an amicable adjustment of our disputes, and pledging
their sacred honors for the safety and good treatment of all
those who should attend and meet them. It not being
convenient for many of us to go to the proposed conference,
a few, from motives of curiosity, attended. They were surprised
to find an armed body of men, prepared for and professing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>hostile intentions. Apprehensions for personal
safety induced those Chiefs to subscribe to every demand
that was asked by the army and its commissioners. Lands
were again demanded, and the lives of some of our Chiefs
were required, as well as those of some innocent traders, as
a sacrifice to appease their anger. Assassins have been
employed to effect some part of their atrocious purpose. If
I fall by the hand of such, I shall fall the victim of the
noblest of causes, that of maintaining the just rights of
my country. I aspire to the honest ambition of meriting
the appellation of the preserver of my country, equally
with the Chiefs among you, whom, from acting on such
principles, you have exalted to the highest pitch of glory.
And if, after every peaceable mode of obtaining redress of
grievances proved fruitless, a recourse to arms to obtain it
be a mark of the savage, and not of the soldier, what
savages must the Americans be, and how much undeserved
applause has your Cincinnatus, your Fabius, obtained. If
a war name had been necessary to distinguish that Chief,
in such a case, the Man-Killer, the Great Destroyer, would
have been the proper appellation.</p>

<p class='c016'>I had appointed the Cussetas, for all the Chiefs of the Lower
Creeks to meet in convention. I shall be down in a few
days, when, from your timely arrival, you will meet the
Chiefs, and learn their sentiments, and I sincerely hope that
the propositions which you shall offer us will be such as we
can safely accede to. The talks of the former commissioners,
at Galphinton, were much approved of, and your coming
from the White Town (seat of Congress) has raised great
expectations, that you will remove the principal and almost
only cause of our dispute, that is, by securing to us our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>hunting-grounds and possessions, free from all encroachments.
When we meet, we shall talk these matters over.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Hon. James White.</span></p>
<p class='c022'>The foregoing letter illustrates the troubles
the Georgians were giving the Creeks,
and the call they made upon McGillivray’s
abilities and influence over his people, in order
to avoid a state of war. No result was reached
by the Cussetas talk. Matters remained in the
same unsatisfactory condition after as before it,
and so continued until after General Washington
became President of the United States in 1789.</p>

<p class='c013'>He appointed a new set of commissioners to
effect a settlement, but these, like the others,
failed to reach a favorable result. On the other
hand, their reports were so alarming that he at
first regarded war as the only remedy for the
troubles existing between the Georgians and
the Creeks. But, wisely concluding that the
country was not then able to bear the burden
of such a costly corrective, he determined to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>make another effort at conciliation. In this
frame of mind the happy thought occurred to
him, that a personal interview between him
and McGillivray might be attended by results
which commissioners had failed to reach.
Acting upon it, he sent an agent to the Creek
nation, in the person of Colonel Marius Willet,
to induce McGillivray to visit New York. The
mission was successful. McGillivray in June,
1790, at the head of thirty of the principal
chiefs of the confederacy, set out on their long
journey mounted on horses.</p>

<p class='c013'>A stage of the journey brought them to Guildford
Court House, where they were honored by
a large assembly of the neighborhood. Suddenly
the throng around the Great Chief opens to a
woman, who rushes up to him, her face bathed
in tears, and then, with blessings upon him,
expresses her gratitude for a good deed done by
him years before, of which she and her children
were the beneficiaries. In an Indian raid her
husband had been killed, and she and her children
carried into captivity. Her benefactor
hearing of their melancholy fate redeemed them,
and gave them a home in his own house, until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>an opportunity was afforded of sending them
to their friends. He was received with distinguished
consideration at Richmond and
Fredericksburg. Philadelphia honored him
and his company with a three days’ entertainment.
Colonel Willet, who accompanied them,
tells us that upon their landing in New York,
the Tammany Society, in full regalia, received
them, attended them to Congress Hall, and
thence to the residence of General Washington.
And then and there, were brought face to face,
the most remarkable white man, and the
most remarkable red man the western hemisphere
had then produced.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whilst the chiefs of the two confederacies are
settling their relations, an interesting event
calls our thoughts from New York to Alabama.
The impressive influence of the Great Chiefs
presence was no sooner withdrawn, than a
large number of the restless Creeks conceived
the purpose of destroying the white settlements
on the Tensas, which had been increasing rapidly
under his protection. The plan, and the
time for its execution were at last fixed. But,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>fortunately, they were revealed to Mrs. Sophia
Durant, the sister of McGillivray.</p>

<p class='c013'>She possessed remarkable command of the
Muscogee language, coupled with the gift of
oratory. She often addressed councils at the
instance of her brother, who, owing to his long
absence from his people in his youth, as well as
the study of other tongues, had lost the full
command of his own.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the time she was informed of the bloody
scheme, she was at her farm on Little river.
Although far under the shadow of maternity
she determines, at every risk to herself, by
prompt action, to save an unsuspecting population
from the terrible fate hanging over them.
She orders two horses to be saddled on the
instant. She mounts one and her trusty negress
the other. More than twice two score human
lives depend upon her reaching Hickory Ground
in time, and that required a ride of sixty miles.
Night and day those two women ride on that
errand of mercy. The only pause was when an
opportunity offered to summon a chief to the
Hickory Ground Council House. The notice
flies from chief to chief, that the sister of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Grand Chief has called a council, to tell them,
doubtless, what he had said to her on “talking
paper.” From all quarters, prompted by interest
and curiosity, there is a rush for the Hickory
Ground. By that device, worthy the genius
of her brother, the council is promptly
assembled. She addresses them with a tone of
mingled authority and persuasion. She tells
them of the scheme that had been disclosed to
her; upbraids them for ingratitude to her
brother, then with the Great White Chief,
who might exact from him and his thirty companions
the lives of the murdered whites; warns
them, too, of the vengeance which he would be
compelled, with the assistance of the whites, to
visit upon the murderers; adding all those
appeals which in such an exigency would come
swelling up from the heart of a noble woman.
From all sides of the assembly come pledges
that the ringleaders shall be seized, and the enterprise
crushed; and promptly and efficiently
it was done. History, story and art have
commemorated the saving of a single life by
Pocahontas; but how insignificant was that
act compared with the one just described! The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>action is further glorified by the fact, that
within two weeks after the noble woman had
saved so many human beings, she added another
life to the long roll of the living.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A treaty was speedily negotiated between
the Creeks and the United States, by which the
Oconee lands referred to in the foregoing letter
were ceded for an annual payment of fifteen
hundred dollars, and a distribution of merchandise.
Questions of boundary were settled; the
Indian territory was guaranteed against farther
encroachment; a permanent peace was provided
for; the Creeks and Seminoles placed
themselves under the jurisdiction of the United
States, and renounced their rights to make
treaties with any other nation. All the Indian
Chiefs besides McGillivray participated in the
negotiation and execution of the treaty.</p>

<p class='c013'>But besides that open one, there was a secret
treaty to which the Grand Chief and the United
States only, were parties. It contained a stipulation,
that after two years the Indian trade
should be turned to points in the United States.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>It provided for annual stipends to be paid to
designated chiefs. McGillivray himself was appointed
Indian agent of the United States, with
the rank of a Brigadier-General, and the yearly
pay of twelve hundred dollars.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c014'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>These treaties were the grounds of severe
criticism upon McGillivray. By the open treaty,
it was said, he made a surrender of the Oconee
county for an inadequate consideration. But
the obvious answer to that objection was, that
he had exhausted every expedient that his clear
and fertile mind could command, to stay the
encroachments of the Georgians without a war,
an alternative which would have eventually
ended in crushing his people. Besides, the
plighted faith of the United States, that no
farther encroachments should be made upon
them, was to them a consideration far exceeding
every other; for history had not then declared,
as it has since, how frail a barrier against
encroachments upon Indian territory is the
plighted faith of the nation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whatever personal advantages he derived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>from the secret treaty, whether pecuniary or in
dignity, inured to the benefit of his people. To
honor him was to give consideration to them;
and they regarded the tributes which his abilities
drew from the British, the Spaniards, and
the Americans, as so many offerings made to
the power of the nation. That each of those
tributaries complained that he was not their
dupe, is alike a proof of his ability, and his
fidelity to his people.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a short time after the New York Treaty
he seemed to be losing the confidence of his
people, through the machinations of the self-styled
General Bowles, who, it will be remembered,
assisted with a body of Choctaws,
Chickasaws and Creeks, in the defense of Pensacola
against Galvez. He was a bold, unprincipled
mischief-maker, who would stop at nothing
that could be turned to his own advantage;
one of those characters who breed suspicion and
create confusion for their own profit and consideration.
To sap the confidence of the Creeks
in their Grand Chief, was to bring about an unsettled
condition of things in which he would
find himself in his element; and for that purpose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>he availed himself of the New York Treaty.
It would have been an easy matter for McGillivray
to have him driven out of the nation, or
by the judgment of a council to have taken his
life; but neither of these courses suiting his policy,
he resolved upon one more subtle and yet
as effectual. He visited New Orleans, where it
was conjectured he held a consultation with
Governor Carondolet, on the subject of ridding
the nation of the mischief-maker. Shortly afterwards,
Bowles was seized by the Spaniards and
sent to Spain. Of the end of his exile we are
informed by a letter of General Washington’s
dated at Mount Vernon, fifth of August, 1793.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c014'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
“On my way to this place I saw Captain Barney
at Baltimore, who had just arrived from
Havana. He says, the day before he left that
place, advice had been received, and generally
believed, that Bowles, who was sent to Spain,
had been hanged.” Thus ended a chequered
life, full of adventures, strange phases, and bad
deeds, which it would be interesting to follow
were this the proper place.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>The New York Treaty was an object of suspicion
both to Panton and the Spaniards,
although they knew nothing of its secret feature;
but they naturally inferred that some other considerations,
besides those made public, must
have induced the United States to honor McGillivray
with the commission and pay of
Brigadier-General.</p>

<p class='c013'>The suspicion, however, resulted profitably to
McGillivray. Before he went to New York he
complained to Panton of the parsimonious conduct
of the Spanish government to him, from
whom it expected, and obtained, so much care
and labor. Believing this supposed slight on
their part was the cause of the favor he manifested
for the Americans, that government at
once took steps to remove it. He was appointed
the Spanish Superintendent-General of the
Creek nation, with a salary of two thousand
dollars, to which fifteen hundred more were
shortly afterwards added.</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon after McGillivray received that appointment,
the Spanish government sent to the Hickory
Ground, as its resident agent, Captain Pedro
Olivier, accompanied by an interpreter. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>man soon became engaged in intrigues to prevent
the running of the boundary lines provided
for by the New York Treaty; and in this
matter he was assisted by William Panton, who
visited the Creek nation for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c013'>This state of things naturally excited the suspicion
of the United States, that McGillivray
was co-operating with Panton and Olivier.
Of any active co-operation by him, however,
there is no evidence, as there is none of his
active opposition to their machinations. He
was too sagacious a man, and had the good
of his people too much at heart to engage
in the latter. The boundary line fixed by the
treaty, had from the first, been exceedingly objectionable
to the Creeks, so much so, that even
the influence of their Grand Chief had failed to
reconcile them to it. Indeed, he himself feared
that such a reconciliation was beyond his ability.
In self-vindication, in the midst of Olivier’s
intrigues, he writes to General Knox, Secretary
of War: “You recollect, sir, that I had great
objection to making the south fork of the
Oconee the limit; and when you insisted so
much, I candidly told you that it might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>made an article, but I would not pledge myself
to get it confirmed.” It was against the running
of that boundary line, that the intrigues
of Olivier and Panton were ostensibly directed;
but their real object was to keep the Creeks in a
ferment in order to exclude their trade from the
Atlantic cities, and confine it to Pensacola; the
question of boundary being seized upon as a
means of accomplishing that end. McGillivray’s
position was one of great delicacy and responsibility.
For him to resist by active opposition
those who opposed the running of the boundary
line, was not only to do something he had
never undertaken to do, but to take a stand
that might divide his people into two hostile
camps, the most calamitous condition that
could befall them.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the midst of these trials, death came to his
relief on the seventeenth of February, 1793, at
Pensacola, whilst on a visit to William Panton.
He was buried with masonic honors, and, it is
said, in Panton’s garden. Unfortunately the
identity of the spot has defied diligent investigation,
and generations have unconsciously desecrated
his dust, as they have that of another distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>man already mentioned. But the suspicion
arises that to a different cause must be
attributed the oblivion that has befallen the
last resting place of the Great Chief, from that
which has been assigned in the case of General
Bouquet’s. Had Panton erected a respectable
brick monument even, over the remains of one
for whom he professed so much friendship, and
who had done so much to increase his fortune,
reverently protecting it up to the time he left
Florida, this generation might be able to direct
the footsteps of the stranger to the tomb of the
most remarkable man to whom Alabama ever
gave birth, and the most extraordinary man
to whom Florida has furnished a grave.</p>

<p class='c013'>He has been accused of deceit and duplicity in
his dealings with the British, the Spaniards and
Americans. But truth and candor, if not exotics,
are not virile growths in the domain of
state craft, while necessity is the ever ready plea
on which adepts in the art, or their apologists,
rest their vindication. When, therefore, the
Great Indian stands condemned at the Bar of
Eternal Truth, well may other statesmen and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>diplomatists whose achievements history delights
to record, shrink from the Judgment Seat.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Grand Chief watched without interference
the struggle of the Spanish and British for supremacy
in West-Florida, because the true
interests of his people pointed to neutrality.
Cavour, the ablest and purest statesman of
recent times, from a like patriotic motive stood
ready, in case of failure, to disavow the invasion
of Naples by Garibaldi, which he had,
nevertheless, secretly promoted. If the New
York treaty was a gross violation of the Pensacola
treaty of 1784, Washington and his cabinet
invited, and encouraged, whatever of bad
faith there was in the transaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>The defense of such characters must rest at
last upon the final judgment of their own nation
upon their life work. So judged, McGillivray
is entitled to no low place on the roll of patriotic
statesmen.</p>

<p class='c013'>For seventeen years, dating from the Creek
troubles in 1776, up to his death, he had been
the guide and shield of his people. For them
those were years of comparative peace, growth,
and preparation for the white man’s civilization,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>by the example afforded in his own person
of its benefits and attractions. With war raging
around them, under his guidance, they
reached a condition which caused him to be
honored, and their alliance sought by two monarchs
and a Great Republic. He moved
amongst them enjoying the reverence and honor
of a patriarchal sheik. Intrigue and detraction
brought him under a transient cloud. But when
they learned his life was closed in death, their
hearts were smitten as those of a family when
it loses its head. There went up from the
Creek land an universal wail; and again, like a
sinister prophecy of evil, there came over it the
shadow it was under before the council of
Coweta.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bitter, too, to his people, was the thought,
that he slept in the “sands of the Seminoles,”
and not on the banks of the beautiful Coosa,
which he loved so well; where he was born,
where he had presided over councils, and made
“paper talk” for their good, and where his hospitality
was ever ready, alike for the distinguished
stranger and the humble wayfarer.</p>

<p class='c016'>The fate of Milfort may interest the reader. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>the death of McGillivray he returned to France, where
in 1802 he published the “Memoire De Mon Sejour Dans
La Nation Crëck,” to which we owe the preservation of
the traditions of that people. But sad to relate, forgetting
his Indian wife, he married a French woman. He was
made General of Brigade by the Emperor Napoleon. He
died in 1814. His French wife was burned to death at
an advanced age at Rheims.</p>

<p class='c012'>Galvez remained but a short time in Pensacola
after the surrender of the British. On their
departure, he returned to New Orleans, the capital
of his province of Louisiana.</p>

<p class='c013'>In May, 1781, Don Arturo O’Niell was appointed
Governor of Spanish West-Florida, and
continued to hold the office until 1792. His
successor was Enrique White, who was succeeded
by Francisco de Paula Gelabert, whose
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad interim</i></span> tenure expired in 1796, by the appointment
of Vicente Folch y Juan.</p>

<p class='c013'>The events of any interest which occurred
before that year, have been already mentioned
in previous chapters. Folch signalized the early
part of his administration by causing a town
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>to be laid out, “between a quarter and half a
mile” from San Carlos, that fort having been
reconstructed between 1781 and 1796.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c014'><sup>[48]</sup></a> This
town was officially known as San Carlos de
Barrancas, that being the original application
to the locality of the Spanish word <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>barranca</i></span>,
signifying broken, in the sense in which the
term is applied to a landscape.</p>

<p class='c013'>Folch’s purpose in laying out the town was,
to substitute it for Pensacola, as the chief town
and capital of the province. Of the real motives
which prompted the design no information can
be obtained. His scheme was defeated, however,
by his inability to procure for it the royal
approval; the probable result of an appeal to
the King by the inhabitants of Pensacola.</p>

<p class='c013'>He afterwards attempted an important
change in the English plan, by laying off into
blocks and lots, so much of the park, or public
place as is now embraced in the area between
Intendencia and Government streets. He also
sold many of the lots, which the purchasers proceeded
to improve. But, when Intendant Morales
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>visited the town in 1806, he utterly disapproved
of Folch’s proceedings, and refused to
confirm the titles of the vendees. Morales’ subsequent
conduct in the matter, however, shows
that in refusing his confirmation he was influenced
more by inimical feeling against the
governor, than any just sense of public duty,
for he himself afterwards granted the lots. This
was the beginning of the mutilation of the great
public place according to the English plan; a
mutilation which was continued from time to
time, until there was nothing left but the two
small plats of ground known as Seville Square,
and that of Ferdinand VII.</p>

<p class='c013'>His administration in one of its earlier years
was marked by one event for which his generation
is entitled to credit. A ship of 800 tons was
built at <i>Caranaro</i>, as the cove in which the
Marine Railway is now situated was then
known. Her name was Pensacola, and during
the decade from 1870, she was still in existence,
making voyages to and from Spanish ports.
This was the first, and thus far, the last private
enterprise of the kind by Pensacolians.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1804, the firm of William Panton &amp; Co.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>was dissolved by the death of William Panton,
who had been, as we have seen, so prominent a
figure in the history of Pensacola, both under
the British and Spanish rule. The business of
the firm was thenceforward carried on under
the style of John Forbes &amp; Co.</p>

<p class='c013'>In October, 1800, Bonaparte compelled Spain
by the treaty of San Ildefonso to cede Louisiana
to France; and France, in 1803, sold and ceded
it to the United States. The United States,
from the time of the purchase, claimed that it
extended eastward to the Perdido, which was
the eastern boundary of Louisiana in the days
of d’Arriola and Iberville, and so remained until
the cession, in 1763, to Great Britain of Florida
by Spain, and of that portion of Louisiana
south of the 31 parallel of N. latitude, east of
the Mississippi, by France. The British, after
that cession, in creating the province of West-Florida,
extended it from the Chattahoochee to
the Mississippi. Spain, on the other hand, after
the treaty of Versailles, restricted West-Florida
to the Perdido, she being at that time the owner
of the whole of Louisiana. When, therefore, she
ceded Louisiana to France, it was, as claimed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>by the United States, Louisiana beginning westward
of the Perdido; for by contracting the
West-Florida of the British, she, to that extent,
extended Louisiana to its original limit, and
left Pensacola within the boundary line tacitly
established by the expeditions of Arriola and
Iberville. Spain did not, however, consent to
that construction. She claimed that British
West-Florida was not embraced in Louisiana;
and the question was not finally settled until
1819, when Florida was ceded to the United
States. It was, from 1803, up to that cession,
a cause of ill feeling and secret hostility on the
part of Spanish officials at Pensacola, towards
the American settlers in the disputed district.</p>

<p class='c013'>Folch’s official term extended to 1809, and
in the number of sovereign masters to whom
he was subject during one year of his administration,
his official life was remarkable. He was
commissioned by Charles IV., who abdicated the
throne of Spain in March, 1808. Upon his abdication,
his eldest son, the Prince of Asturias,
was proclaimed King, under the title of Ferdinand
VII. On May 10, Bonaparte, having insidiously
enticed Ferdinand to Bayonne, compelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>him, by threats against his life, to resign
his crown. On June sixth, of the same year,
Joseph Bonaparte was proclaimed King of
Spain, by no other real authority than the will
of his imperial brother.</p>

<p class='c013'>Never did any event arouse the patriotic
resentment of a people, as Spain’s was
aroused, by the ignominy of witnessing her lawful
King deposed, to enable an adventurer to
assume his crown. The French Emperor marched
army after army into the country, to establish
the new dynasty by overawing the people
into submission. But army corps led by marshals,
whose names had theretofore been the synonyms
of victory, only intensified the spirit of
resistance. As one man, from the shore of the
Mediterranean to the Bay of Biscay, the population
flew to arms. Mountain and plain, hill
and valley, rang with their battle cry as they
hastened to their cities, towns, and villages, to
be organized into military commands. The
patriotic passion that fired every heart in the
Kingdom, was shared by Spaniards in every
quarter of the globe. Of the sympathy of Pensacola
with the great patriotic movement in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>mother country, there exists memorials in the
names of some of its streets, and its chief public
square.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was in the fervor of that sympathy that the
square received the name of the exiled monarch;
a token of loyalty, of which, however, he
proved himself unworthy by his conduct after
his restoration to the throne. Never had a
monarch a better opportunity of making his
reign happy and illustrious, and never did one
under such conditions make it a source of
greater shame to himself, and misery to his
people. He was not by nature a cruel, or a bad
man; but he was neither firm nor truthful;
two weaknesses in a ruler which may prove as
fruitful a source of political crimes as a natural
inclination to evil actions. In his first proclamation
after re-ascending the throne, amid the
enthusiastic joy of his people, he said, “I detest,
I abhor despotism;” yet he, afterwards, lent
himself to schemes which deprived Spain of
constitutional government, restored the inquisition,
and led to proscriptions involving the
lives of some of the patriots who had contributed
so largely to the restoration of his crown.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>The cruel and despotic policy of his advisers, at
length, drove the liberal party into a widespread
revolt, which would have resulted in his
permanent dethronement, but for the intervention
of the French, who, in 1823, enabled him
by their arms to keep on his head the crown
they had snatched from it in 1808.</p>

<p class='c013'>But, if in the chief square of the town there
be a reminder of a perfidious monarch, there
are in some of its streets memorials of Spanish
glory.</p>

<p class='c013'>The English names of those streets were
changed to the names they bear, at the time
when the events with which the latter are
associated occurred, and were designed to be
commemorative monuments of the glory shed
upon old Spain by the illustrious deeds of her
sons. Upon their being monumental, must rest
the apology for a slight retracing of their
legends, which would otherwise be out of place
in this book.</p>

<p class='c013'>Palafox and Saragossa, or Zaragoza, are the
first to arrest attention, as they are likewise
suggestive one of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>José de Palafox y Melzi, whose ancestral seat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>was near the city of Zaragoza, was in 1808, a
young officer of the King’s guards. He accompanied
Ferdinand on his visit to Bayonne,
which ended in the King’s abdication. It was
by him the captive King sent the instructions
to the Junta which was to exercise the sovereignty
of the Spanish people during the exile of
their monarch. Having performed that duty,
Palafox went to Zaragoza, to join in the
uprising of Aragon, of which it was the capital.
Despite his lack of years and experience, his
commanding presence led the Aragonese, full of
patriotic ardor and warlike impulse, to choose
him as their leader, and proclaim him Captain
General of Aragon. In a short time he found
himself at the head of ten thousand infantry,
two hundred horse, and eight pieces of artillery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Zaragoza, situated on the right bank of the
Ebro, was, in 1808, a city of fifty thousand
inhabitants. It stood in the midst of an alluvial
plain, rich in its olive trees, its vineyards,
and agricultural products. Its fortifications
consisted of a brick wall not above ten feet
high and three in thickness, pierced for guns,
but few were in the embrasures. At intervals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>however, there were convents, castles, and
other solid stone structures. The universal
uprising of the Aragonese, and the proximity of
the city to the French frontiers, suggested it as
one of the most important points for the French
to occupy, in the execution of their designs to
subjugate Spain. It was, accordingly, one of
the first places against which a military force
was sent.</p>

<p class='c013'>In June 1808, Napoleon ordered Lefebvre to
advance against it from the Pyrenian frontier.
His advance was interrupted by three battles,
in which the raw and undisciplined Aragonese
peasants did not hesitate to attack the French
column, but were in each instance driven back.
Lefebvre at last presented himself before
Zaragoza, with a demand for its submission.
To that demand Palafox made the memorable
reply, “War to the knife;” a reply that foreshadowed
the terrific struggle by which those
old brick walls were to be won by the enemy.
In every attack the French made upon the gates
and walls, between the twelfth of June and
August fifteenth, they were repulsed with
fearful loss. Lefebvre, discouraged by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>successive failures to carry the place by storm,
drew off his army to await the arrival of heavy
artillery, to enable him to undertake a regular
siege.</p>

<p class='c013'>The second attempt on Zaragoza began in
December, 1808. In the interval between this
and the first attack the defences had been
greatly strengthened, and a large supply of arms
procured. As the French columns advanced
towards the city there was presented a spectacle
not often witnessed by one doomed to a
siege. The entire population, men, women and
children, were engaged in the work of preparing
for resistance. None left the walls, but on the
contrary the peasantry of the surrounding
country rushed within them to share in the
perilous defence. By the time the French took
their position around the city, it had within
it fifty thousand defenders, the most of them
undisciplined and uninured to arms, yet animated
with the spirit of their leader’s reply to
Lefebvre’s demand of surrender.</p>

<p class='c013'>The French force consisted of two army corps
of fifty thousand men, commanded by Marshals
Moncey and Montier, with all the necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>artillery and appliances for a siege. For fifty
days after the French artillery began to play
upon the city the conflict between the besieged
and the besiegers was incessant. In that time,
thirty-three thousand cannon shot, and sixteen
thousand bombs had been hurled against the
place. When a breach was made in the wall,
immediately and under the terrific fire of the
enemy it was closed up with sand bags. If at
any point an entry was made within them by
the besiegers, the stone houses became citadels
for the besieged. If the defenders were driven
from a room, a stand was made in the next one.
Women and children shared in the labors and
the perils of the fight. As a gunner fell at the
feet of his wife, stricken down by a cannon shot,
she promptly took his place at the gun.
Napoleon, dissatisfied with the slow progress
made by Moncey and Montier towards a
reduction of the place, sent Junot to take the
command. Becoming dissatisfied with him, he
sent Lannes to bring the operations to a close.
Pestilence, too, came to his aid as well as additional
forces sent by the Emperor. At last Palafox
was confined to his bed with the prevailing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>epidemic. The French soldiers were at the same
time depressed by the fierce and uninterrupted
conflict. “Scarce a fourth of the town is won,”
said one of them, “and we are already exhausted.
We shall all perish amongst these ruins,
which will become our own tombs, before we
can force the last of these fanatics from the last
of their dens.” With the assailants thus depressed,
and the besieged deprived of the presence
and encouragement of their leader, besides
the havoc of pestilence, a favorable capitulation
was accepted by Marshal Lannes. The regular
troops marched out of the walls with the
honors of war, and were sent as prisoners into
France, each soldier retaining his knapsack, the
officers their horses and side arms. The peasants
were dismissed, and private property was
respected. Fifty thousand human beings perished
during the siege, all, except six thousand,
from pestilence. Palafox remained a prisoner
in France until 1814, when he returned to
Spain. He was afterwards created Duke of
Zaragoza, and died in 1847.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of this siege a British historian has said:
“Modern Europe has not such a memorable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>siege to recount; and to the end of the world,
even after Spain and France have sunk before
the waves of time, and all the glories of modern
Europe have passed away, it will stand forth
in undecaying lustre; a monument of heroic
devotion, which will thrill the hearts of the
brave and generous throughout every succeeding
age.”<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c014'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Baylen, a parallel street with Palafox, next
invites notice. Baylen is a small town at the
foot of the Sierra Morena, on the road leading
from Cadiz to Cordova and Seville. There, on
July nineteenth, 1808, the French General
Dupont, after his recent plunder of Cordova,
with excesses more in keeping with the days of
Alaric, than the nineteenth century, was, with
20,000 men, and all their plunder, compelled to
surrender, after a series of battles to a Spanish
army, largely made up of irregular Spanish
troops.</p>

<p class='c013'>To Reding, a Swiss in the service of Spain,
was due the glory of the event, which excited
profound attention throughout Europe, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>made a deep and sinister impression on the
French.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the “catastrophe” Napoleon, who was at
Bordeaux when he heard of it, said: “That an
army should be beaten, is nothing; it is the
daily fate of war and is easily repaired; but
that an army should submit to a dishonorable
capitulation is a stain upon the glory of our
arms which can never be effaced. Wounds inflicted
on honor are incurable. The moral effect
of this catastrophe will be terrible.” Baylen
was doubtless the first link in the chain of
events which drew from him the reflection in
which he indulged at St. Helena: “It was that
unhappy war in Spain which ruined me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Romana street bears the name of the most
illustrious General Spain produced during her
great Peninsula war—the Marquis de Romana.
He was one of those great and generous characters
who are too great and generous to be
moved by selfishness or envy, and was in consequence
the bond of union between the English
and Spanish armies. He was marching to the
relief of Badajoz, when he was seized with heart
disease at Cartaxo, where he died suddenly January
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>22, 1811. It is enough for his fame for
him to have been the subject of the following
dispatch by the Duke of Wellington: “In the
Marquis de Romana, the Spanish army has lost
its brightest ornament, his country its most
upright patriot, and the world the most strenuous
and zealous defender in the cause in which
we are engaged; and I shall always acknowledge
with gratitude the assistance which I
received from him, as well by his operation, as
by his counsel, since he has been joined with the
army.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Alcaniz is a reminder of another field of
Spanish glory. It is the name of a town in Aragon,
on the right bank of the Guadalupe, sixty
miles south-east of Zaragoza. It was, on May
twenty-third, 1809, the scene of the defeat of a
French army under Suchet by the Spanish forces
under General Blake.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tarragona street commemorates one of those
sieges like that of Saragossa, which signalize
the Spanish race above all others, for the tenacity
and devotion with which in all ages it has
defended its homes. The city of that name,
situated on the Mediterranean shore of Spain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>was besieged by Suchet, and defended by General
Cortinas, from May 4, to June 29,
1811. The defense was conducted with
the same fierce obstinacy and courage which
marked that of Saragossa, and with even
greater mortality, if allowance is made for the
ravages of pestilence in the latter. But there
was a vast difference in the finality of the two
sieges. Tarragona was taken by assault; and
never did American savages exercise more
demon-like fury upon unresisting and powerless
humanity than the French troops visited upon
the Tarragonese. Above six thousand human
beings comprising all ages, and both sexes,
were massacred whilst appealing for mercy.
“The blood of the Spaniards inundated the
streets and the houses. Armed and unarmed,
men and women, gray hairs and infant innocence,
attractive youth and wrinkled age, were
alike butchered by the infuriated troops.”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c014'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Folch Leaves West Florida—His Successors—War of 1812—Tecumseh’s
Visit to the Seminoles and Creeks—Consequences—Fort
Mims—Percy and Nicholls’ Expedition.</p>

<p class='c012'>In October, 1809, Folch left Pensacola to fill
the appointment of Governor of the country
west of the Perdido, the capital of which was
Mobile. The uneventful period, for Pensacola
at least, between that year and 1813, was
marked only by the incoming and outgoing of
governors. Folch’s successor was his son-in-law,
Don Francisco Maximiliano de Saint
Maxent, under an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad interim</i></span> appointment. In
July 1812, he was succeeded by Mauricio
Zuniga, who in May, 1813, gave place to Mateo
Gurzalez Maurique, whose administration
covered the period of the war between the
United States and Great Britain, which was
declared by the former, on June 18, 1812.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>That Pensacola should have been involved in
that struggle would seem to be out of the
natural order of events, when it is remembered
that Spain and the United States were at peace.
But, as before intimated, there existed a covert
hostility on the part of the Spanish officials at
Pensacola against the Americans, growing out
of the dispute as to the limits of West Florida;
and now intensified by the capture of Mobile
on April 13, 1813, by an expedition from New
Orleans, under the command of General Wilkinson.
Spain herself was too much absorbed by
her struggle for existence to take any active
interest in a question of boundary in the new
world. But the British, who were her allies in
her war with the French, availed themselves of
that official hostility to induce the Spaniards at
Pensacola to permit them to make that place a
base from which the Indians could be furnished
with supplies to wage war on the United
States.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the capture of Detroit, in August, 1812,
the British formed the scheme of combining the
Indians on the western frontier of the United
States in a line of warfare extending from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. As their chief emissary
to accomplish that end, they employed
Tecumseh, the great Shawnee Chief, who in the
fall of that year made his appearance amongst
the Seminoles and Creeks. He at once began
the work of exciting their hostility against the
Americans, by every argument, art, and device
which his own savage shrewdness could suggest,
or the deliberate calculations of his British
allies prompt. He addressed the Creek assemblies
with the burning words of an impassioned
oratory, to which his stately form and commanding
presence gave additional force. He upbraided
their disposition to adopt the speech, the dress,
and habits of the white man, instead of cleaving
to those of their forefathers. He persuaded
them that it was degrading to an Indian warrior
to follow the plow, or to rely upon cattle
and the fruits of the field for sustenance; that it
was decreed by the Great Spirit that the country
should go back to the forest, and that the
Indian should depend upon the chase for his
food, as his forefathers had done. An invidious
contrast was drawn between the disinterested
friendship of the British, who had no occasion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>or use for their lands, and the cupidity of the
Americans who were annually restricting their
hunting grounds by their ever extending settlements.
Superstition, and necromancy, too, were
successfully employed to enforce his teachings.
Some of the wavering, like Francis, afterwards
known as the prophet, were induced to submit
to days of seclusion and fasting, in houses from
which the light was excluded, until darkness,
spells, and incantations, acting upon bodies
enfeebled by hunger, inspired faith in the mission
of the great Shawnee. A comet, which appeared
in the last days of September of that
year, was pointed to as a sign placed in the
heavens by the Great Spirit, as a presage of
wrath and destruction to the white man, and a
promise of redemption to the Indian.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had the temerity, even, to foretell a great
natural phenomenon of which he was to be the
proximate cause, as an evidence his mission
was inspired. “When I reach Detroit I shall
stamp my foot, and the earth will tremble and
rock.” And strange to relate, at about the
lapse of time the journey would consume, an
earthquake was felt throughout the Creek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>country, when from all sides came the cry of
the awe-stricken Indians: “Tecumseh has reached
Detroit and stamped his foot.”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c014'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>His mission divided the Creeks into two parties,
of which by far the most numerous and
warlike, was that which yielded to his seductions.
To each of his converts he gave a red
stick as an emblem of war, and hence the hostile
Creeks became known as “Red Sticks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had hardly returned to Detroit, when
there came to Pensacola British agents, bringing
with them military supplies for distribution
amongst the Red Sticks, to whose bloody instincts
was applied the stimulus of a bounty
of five dollars for every American scalp.</p>

<p class='c013'>That Pensacola should be the Creek base of
supply, was in accordance with the plan of
warfare designed by the British at Detroit, and
a fulfillment of Tecumseh’s promised assistance
to their savage allies. After the arrival there of
the British agents and their stores, the Red
Sticks lost no time in procuring from them the
needed supplies for the war to which they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>pledged themselves. From all parts of the
Creek country the hostiles were seen hurrying
to Pensacola, and returning with arms and ammunition,
without hindrance from the Spanish
officials.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first startling result of the alliance
between the British and Indians, was the massacre
of Fort Mims, which occurred in August,
1813, an event that sent a thrill of horror
through every American heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fort was situated on Lake Tensas, a mile
east of the Alabama river. It consisted of a
stockade enclosing about an acre, with a blockhouse
in one of its angles. In the center of it
stood the residence of Samuel Mims, for whom
it was named. It had been hastily constructed,
as a refuge for the people of the neighborhood,
in anticipation of an extended war, rendered
imminent by encounters that had taken place
between small parties of Indians and whites.
In July, there entered the stockade five hundred
and fifty-three souls, composed of soldiers, other
men, women and children. Owing to the ill
chosen site, situated as it was in a hammock,
and the negligence of those in command, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>place was surprised at midday on August 30,
by one thousand Creek Indians under William
Weatherford and Francis, who rushed in at
the open gate, which had been heedlessly left unclosed.
But few of those in the Fort escaped.
All the dead were scalped, except those who
were saved from that outrage, by undergoing
the process of cremation in the buildings in
which they had taken refuge, and which were
fired by the enemy to overcome their defenders.
Their bloody work finished, the Indians rested
and feasted, at the scene of the massacre, smoking
their pipes, and trimming and drying the
scalps they had taken. Afterwards, these horrid
trophies of victory, strung on sticks, were
taken to the British agents at Pensacola, who
paid for them the promised bounty.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is due to William Weatherford, who was a
son of a half-sister of Alexander McGillivray,
that, it should be mentioned, at the peril of
his own life, he interfered to save the women
and children. Failing in his merciful efforts, he
refused to witness their massacre, and left the
bloody scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not content with making Pensacola a base
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>for inciting the Indians to hostilities against
the United States, in 1814, there came into the
harbor a British fleet, with a body of marines,
the former under the command of Captain
William Henry Percy, and the later under that
of Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Nicholls, for the
purpose of taking possession of its fortifications.
This the imbecile Maurique permitted them to
do. Fort George, which had been named St.
Michael by the Spaniards, resumed its English
name, and received a British garrison, whilst
the flag of St. George once again floated from
its ramparts. Fort San Carlos and the battery
on Santa Rosa Island were also turned over to
the British. And at the same time, the
Governor’s house was made the headquarters
of Percy and Nicholls.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fleet consisted of two ships, each of
twenty-four guns, and two brigs, each of
eighteen guns, with three tenders. The marines
numbered two to three hundred men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nicholls at once began to increase his force by
enlisting Indians, whom he supplied with
British uniforms, and drilled in the streets of
Pensacola.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Thus reads his order of the day, twenty-sixth
of August 1814. “The noble Spanish nation
has grieved to see her territories insulted,
having been robbed and despoiled of a portion
of them while she was overwhelmed with
distress, and held down by the chains which a
tyrant had imposed on her gloriously struggling
for the greatest of all blessings (true liberty).
The treacherous Americans, who call themselves
free, have attacked her like assassins while she
was fallen. But the day of retribution is fast
approaching.... As to the Indians, you are
to exhibit to them the most exact discipline,
being patterns to these children of nature. You
will teach and instruct them, in doing which
you will manifest the utmost patience, and you
will correct them when they deserve it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Percy in a communication to Lafitte, the
commander of the <a id='e5'></a>Barrataria pirates, says: “As
France and England are now friends, I call on
you with your brave followers to enter into the
service of Great Britain, in which you shall have
the rank of Captain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Nicholls likewise issued a proclamation to the
people of Louisiana and Kentucky, inviting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>them to join the British. To the latter he
addressed himself specially as follows: “Inhabitants
of Kentucky, you have too long borne
with grievous impositions. The whole brunt of
the war has fallen on your brave sons. Be
imposed upon no more. Either range yourselves
under the standard of your forefathers, or
observe a strict neutrality.”<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c014'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>And as an additional stimulus to the activity
and zeal of the Indians, the bounty on American
scalps was raised from five to ten dollars.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c014'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Attack on Fort Boyer by Percy and Nicholls—Jackson’s
March on Pensacola in 1814—The Town Captured—Percy
and Nicholls Driven Out—Consequences of the
War to the Creeks—Don Manuel Gonzalez.</p>

<p class='c012'>The first aggressive operation of Percy and
Nicholls against the Americans after they had
established themselves at Pensacola was an
attack on Fort Boyer on Mobile Point, preparatory
to an advance on Mobile. But General
Jackson’s great victory of the Horse Shoe over
the Creeks on the twenty-seventh of March
had effectually crushed them, and the treaty
with them which followed enabled him to direct
his attention exclusively to the movements of
the British at Pensacola.</p>

<p class='c013'>His first step was to put Fort Boyer in condition
to resist an attack, by repairing it,
mounting additional guns and placing an ample
garrison in it. This preparation had hardly
been accomplished, when, early in September,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>1814, the British commanders made a combined
attack upon it by land and water. The
former was repulsed, and the latter resulted in
the destruction of the <i>Hermes</i>, Percy’s flag ship,
and the drawing off of the other vessels in a
crippled condition. After the inglorious expedition,
the British fleet and land forces
retired to Pensacola—a result hardly in keeping
with the vaunts of Percy and Nicholls
in their several proclamations issued in August.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pensacola having lost all claim to neutrality,
as well by being under the British flag, as by
becoming a refuge for the hostile Indians who
declined to bring themselves within the terms
of the treaty which General Jackson had made
with the Creeks after the victory at the Horse
Shoe, he resolved to advance upon it. He had
previously written Maurique a letter reminding
him of the peaceful relations between Spain and
the United States, expostulating with him upon
his permitting the British to make Pensacola
the base of their operations, and allowing it to
be an asylum for the hostile Creeks, naming
two of them especially, McQueen and Francis,
whose strange adventures will be mentioned in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>a future page. To this mild expostulation the
governor made an ambiguous and insulting
reply, ending with the threat “that Jackson
should hear from him shortly.”<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c014'><sup>[54]</sup></a> The correspondence
occurred just before the Percy and
Nicholls’ attack on Fort Boyer, and doubtless
it was their bombastic prediction of success
which prompted old Maurique to send Jackson
so defiant reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>General Jackson, however, did not wait
longer than the last days of October, 1814, for
the execution of the Spanish governor’s threat.
Having collected his forces at Fort Montgomery,
on the twenty-seventh he took up his
line of march for Pensacola, the Indian trail referred
to in an early chapter being its guiding
thread. The troops consisted of the Third,
Thirty-ninth and Forty-fourth infantry,
Coffee’s brigade, a company of Mississippi
dragoons and part of a West Tennessee regiment,
numbering three thousand effective men,
besides a band of friendly Choctaws.</p>

<p class='c013'>He reached the vicinity of the town on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>evening of the sixth of November. He first appeared
on its western side, and there, having
halted, he says, in the dispatch containing an
account of the expedition, “On my approach I
sent Major Pierre with a flag to communicate
the object of my visit. He approached the Fort
St. George with his flag displayed, and was
fired on by the cannon from the fort.”<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c014'><sup>[55]</sup></a> Immediately
afterwards, with the adjutant and a
small party, he himself made a reconnoissance.
He found the fort manned by Spanish as well as
English troops. He likewise observed that
there were in the harbor seven English war
vessels, which it was necessary for him to consider
in his future movements. His plans were
at once formed. A force under Captain Denkins,
with several pieces of artillery, occupied the site
of Fort St. Barnardo, which was once again to
be pitted against its old antagonist, Fort
George.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c014'><sup>[56]</sup></a> Inferring that the enemy would expect
his attack from the west, General Jackson,
on the night of the sixth, caused the main body
of his army to make a circuitous march, so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>the morning would find it on the eastern extremity
of the town.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c014'><sup>[57]</sup></a> This movement shielded
him from the guns of St. George or St. Michael,
whilst by entering the town at the eastern end
of Government street he would, in a measure,
be protected from the guns of the English vessels.
But he encountered a battery of two guns
as he entered the street, which fired upon the
centre column with ball and grape, whilst there
opened upon the troops a shower of musketry
from houses, fences and gardens.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c014'><sup>[58]</sup></a> The battery
was soon silenced, however, by a storming
party led by Captain Laval, who lost a leg at
the last fire of the guns. All the Spanish forces
at the battery fled as Laval’s command rushed
upon it except a gallant Spanish officer, who,
refusing to fly, was taken prisoner. But tradition
says, instead of laurels, he won from his
own people the imputation of “fool” for his
rashness—a rashness, however, which, had it
been crowned with success, would probably
have secured him the praise of a hero.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>When the command had well advanced into
the town it was met by the governor in person,
with a white flag, and an offer of surrender at
discretion. The offer was accepted, but solely
for the purpose of enabling General Jackson to
accomplish the declared object of the expedition—which
was not conquest—but to expel the
British, whose presence was due to the imbecility
of Maurique, as well as the small
Spanish force at his command, consisting, as it
did, of two or three companies of the regiment
of Tarragona. In order to attain that object,
possession of Forts Barrancas and St. Michael
by the Americans was indispensable, and, to
the extent of his ability, the governor made the
surrender. But when Captain Denkins and his
command were about to proceed to take possession
of St. Michael, Captain Soto, the
Spanish officer in command, refused to obey the
governor’s instructions to make the surrender.
Preparations that were immediately made to
take it by storm, however, induced Soto to reconsider
his refusal and to admit the American
command. The demand was made at six o’clock
on the evening of the seventh, and the surrender
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>occurred at midnight. The purpose of Soto’s
delay cannot be divined, for Nicholls having on
the night of the sixth withdrawn his men to
the shipping, there remained in the fort but a
small band of Spaniards.</p>

<p class='c013'>As General Jackson withdrew his forces from
the town, which he did on the evening of the
same day of its capture, they were fired upon
by the British vessels, but without inflicting
any injury.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whilst, on the morning of the eighth, a
detachment was preparing to march on Barrancas,
with the purpose of cutting off the
retreat of the British fleet, there was heard a
great explosion, which it was at once concluded
was occasioned by the blowing up of San Carlos.
General Jackson nevertheless sent the
detachment there to verify the fact. On its
return in the night it reported the fort blown
up, everything combustible burned, and cannon
spiked by the British, who had taken to their
ships, and sailed out of the harbor.</p>

<p class='c013'>The only casualties which occurred <a id='e7'></a>during these
operations on the part of the Americans were
seven killed and eleven wounded, including
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Captain Laval; and on the part of the Spaniards
four killed and six wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Captain William Laval was a South Carolinian,
the son of a French officer of the Legion of
Lauzun, belonging to the French forces in the
Revolutionary war. In 1808 he received the
commission of ensign in the American army. In
1812, he became a first lieutenant. The breaking
out of the Creek war found him a captain.
He was with the third regiment, to which his
company belonged, at the battle of Holy Ground.
For the service of charging the Spanish battery
at Pensacola he was specially selected by
General Jackson. The loss of his leg prevented
his sharing with his regiment in the glorious
victory of New Orleans, and ended his military
career as well. His aptitude for civil as well as
military life was manifested by his filling the
offices of Secretary of State, Comptroller General,
and Treasurer of South Carolina, as well as
Assistant Treasurer of the United States under
Polk’s administration.</p>

<p class='c013'>That the presence of the British was enforced,
and by no means agreeable to the Spaniards,
was promptly manifested by the good feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>exhibited by the latter towards the Americans,
as soon as Percy and Nicholls had taken their
departure. The inhabitants were much impressed
by the kind and generous conduct of
General Jackson; who seems fully, to have
appreciated the peculiar position in which the
town was placed, by the pretentious audacity
of Percy and Nicholls, the feebleness of its
garrison, and above all the imbecility of Maurique.
In the dispatch before referred to he says:
“The good order and conduct of my troops,
whilst in Pensacola, have convinced the Spaniards
of our friendship and our prowess; and
have drawn from the citizens an expression,
that ‘The Choctaws are more civilized than the
British.’” In letters written from Pensacola to
Havana, in relation to the capture of the place,
the comparison is thus expressed: “the American
Choctaws were more civilized than the
religious English.” These letters teem with the
praises of the considerate conduct of General
Jackson and his army.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the first account of the invasion
reached Havana, American vessels were seized
as a retaliatory measure; but when all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>particulars of the expedition were learned they
were promptly released.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having blown up St. Michael, General
Jackson left Pensacola, on November 9, to go
to the defence of New Orleans, which from all
indications was threatened with an attack by
the British. There he arrived with his army,
on December 2, to begin those preparations
which were to end on January 8, in the grand
and glorious land victory of the War of 1812.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Percy and Nicholls left Pensacola, they
took with them, not only their Indian allies,
but also about one hundred negro slaves belonging
to the inhabitants of the town. Sailing
to Appalachicola, they there landed the Indians
and negroes. Still bent on instigating a savage
warfare against the American settlements, a
fort under their directions was built on the Appalachicola
river, which they supplied with guns
and ammunition. It was designed to serve as a
refuge for fugitive slaves, and a resort for hostile
Indians, as well as a salient point from
which to carry on an exterminating warfare
against the white settlements in southern Georgia
and Alabama.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Such were the inglorious results of the Percy-Nicholls
expedition to Florida, beginning, as we
have seen, with stilted proclamations to the
people of Louisiana and Kentucky, coupled
with an invitation to a nest of pirates to
become their allies; and ending with the robbing
and destruction of the property of a community
to which they had come under the guise
of friendship, and as its shield from wrongs
which existed in their own imaginations only.</p>

<p class='c013'>Aside from the barbarity which marked the
warfare instigated by Britain against the
Americans in Florida and Alabama during the
years 1812-1814, history has cause to lament
its fatal consequences to the people who were
the cruel instruments by which it was waged.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the time of Tecumseh’s mission to the
Creeks, about twenty years had elapsed since
the death of their Great Chief, McGillivray. In
that interval, under the impulse of his teachings
and example, continued and increased by the
fostering care of the United States, they had
made considerable advance in civilization.
Large numbers of them had learned to rely
more upon tillage and their herds for a livelihood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>than on the chase. It was no uncommon thing
to see in the nation, well-built houses standing
in the midst of considerable farms. They owned
slaves and large herds of cattle. The hum of
the spinning wheel, and the noise of the shuttle,
moved by the deft hands of Indian matrons,
were common sounds throughout the Creek
country; whilst an Indian maiden with her
milk pail, or at her churn, was no unusual sight.
The schools established amongst them were
gradually shedding upon them the light and
mellowing influence of knowledge.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c014'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The large infusion of white blood into the
tribe, owing to the attractions of the Creek
women, which have already been noticed, likewise,
added the hope of a civilization resting
upon the strongest instincts of human nature.
Of the possibility of this civilizing and ennobling
influence, gradually permeating and elevating
the Creeks as a people, we have the evidence
in some of their descendants, who at this day,
are amongst the most respectable citizens in
several communities in Alabama and Florida.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Such was the state of the Creek nation, when
the British at Detroit sent Tecumseh, like
another Prince of Evil, into that fair garden of
a nascent civilization, to convert its peaceful
scenes into fields of slaughter, with all the woes
that follow in the footsteps of war.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first fruit of that cruel scheme, as we
have seen, was the tragedy of Fort Mims.
Then followed in rapid succession the avenging
battles of Tallasehatchee, Talladega, Auttose,
and Holy Ground. To those succeeded the last
great heroic struggle at the Horse Shoe, in
which, of one thousand Red Sticks engaged,
two hundred only survived. Afterwards came
the surrender of Weatherford with that speech<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c014'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>which comes to us as the dirge-like epilogue of
the woeful drama; and a memorial of that prophetic
shadow which fell on his people when
they learned their Grand Chief was lying in the
“sands of the Seminoles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The Spaniards criticised General Jackson’s
Florida campaign, because he did not, instead
of advancing on Pensacola, proceed at once
to Barrancas, to capture San Carlos, and thereby
prevent the escape of the British vessels.
But the answer to the criticism is, that he was
not aware, perhaps, of all the conditions known
to the Spaniards, which in their judgment,
would have facilitated a surprise, or contributed
to a successful assault. Besides, such a movement
would have been inconsistent with the
purpose of his invasion, which was to procure
the exclusion of the British from Florida, by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>action of the Spaniards themselves; a consideration
which was due to the amicable relations
existing between Spain and the United States.
Entertaining these views, General Jackson did
not deem it proper to seize the Spanish forts in
the first instance without communicating with
the Governor. This he attempted to do, and it
was only after the outrage of firing on his flag,
he resolved, without further parley or remonstrance,
by his own arms to drive out the
British.</p>

<p class='c013'>That, however, he had considered a movement
on Barrancas, before or at the time of his
advance on Pensacola, is evidenced by an interview
which he had with Don Manuel Gonzalez,
who was an officer in the Spanish commissary
department, and who had a cattle ranch
at a place then known as Vacaria Baja, now as
Oakfield, one mile from the trail the American
army was following. Don Manuel, with his
family, was at the ranch, when the General rode
up to the house, and accosted him. There was
with the Don at the time, his son, Celestino,
then a young man. Through an interpreter,
the General made known, that the purpose of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>his visit was to require the Don, or his son, to
guide the army to Barrancas. The Don boldly
refusing, the General became insistent, to the
degree of threatening the use of force to secure
compliance. Roused by the threat, with a mien
as dauntless as Jackson’s, Don Manuel replied:
“General, my life and my property are in your
power; you can take both; but my honor is in
my own keeping. As to my son, I would rather
plunge a sword into his bosom than see him a
traitor to his king.” The General replied by
extending his hand with the exclamation, “I
honor a brave man,” and thenceforth became
his friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seminole War, 1818—Jackson Invades East Florida—Defeats
the Seminoles—Captures St. Marks—Arbuthnot
and Ambrister—Prophet Francis—His Daughter.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the close of the war between the United
States and Great Britain, the British troops
were withdrawn from the fort on the Appalachicola
river built under the auspices of Nicholls
and Percy.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Seminoles were, as their name signifies,
outlaws and runaways from the Creek confederacy,
or their descendants. Hence it was, that
those of the Red Sticks who refused to submit
to the terms of the treaty between the United
States and the Creeks, either fled to the British
at Pensacola, or to the Seminole nation. It was
in a district inhabited by Seminoles, that the
fort built by Nicholls on the Appalachicola river
was situated. The spirit and objects which
prompted its construction continued to animate
its motley garrison long after Nicholls’ departure.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>At length it proved such an interruption
to navigation, besides being an asylum for
runaway negroes, as to bring against it, in
1816, an expedition by land and water under
Colonel Duncan L. Clinch. A shot from a gunboat
exploded the magazines and destroyed the
larger part of the garrison. The destruction of
this nest of rapine, however, did not for long
give peace and security to the district.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the fall of 1817, a feeling of unrest and suspicion
mutually seized upon the white settlers and
Indians, induced by causes for which both were
responsible. The first act of war, however, was
the capture on November 21 of Fowlton, a Seminole
village above the Georgia line, by an American
force, under Colonel Twiggs. This proved the
signal for Indian massacres, the most shocking
of which was that of Lieutenant Scott and his
command. Whilst going up the Appalachicola
river in a barge they were attacked from a
dense swamp on the bank. There were in the
barge forty men besides Scott, seven soldiers’
wives, and five children. All were killed except
one woman spared by the Indians, and four
men who swam to the opposite bank.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>In March 1818, General Jackson was ordered
to the seat of war. He invaded East Florida,
and in a campaign of six weeks crushed the
Indians. In one of their towns, were found
three hundred scalps of men, women and
children, fifty still fresh hanging from a red war
pole. He also captured the Spanish Post of
Saint Marks.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the last act, investigation can find no
adequate reason. It was not, however, an
irremediable wrong, for restitution furnished
a remedy. Two irreparable wrongs, however,
marked that short campaign.</p>

<p class='c013'>Alexander Arbuthnot, being found at St.
Marks, was brought before a court-martial.
He was a man of seventy years of age, a Scotchman,
an Indian trader, and a friend of the
Indians, but a counsellor of peace between them
and the whites; a man of education, who used
his pen to represent Indian wrongs to both
Spanish and American officials; and who, when
Jackson was about to invade their country,
advised the Seminoles to fly and not to fight.
On his trial, the plainest rules of evidence were
disregarded, and without proof he was found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>guilty of the charges of inciting the Creeks to
war on the United States and, likewise, of
“aiding and abetting the enemy, and supplying
them with the means of war.” Under that
baseless judgment the old man was hanged;
his waving white locks protesting his innocence.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c014'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Robert C. Ambrister, who had formerly belonged
to Nicholls’ command, being found in
the Indian nation, was also seized and tried by
a court-martial. He confessed that he had counselled
and aided the Indians. The court at first
sentenced him to be shot, but before closing the
trial, upon a reconsideration it set aside that
judgment, and substituted for death the
punishment of fifty stripes, and confinement
“with a ball and chain at hard labor for
twelve months.” Nevertheless, General Jackson
disregarding the last, executed the first judgment.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c014'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Jackson having early in May closed his
campaign against the East Florida Seminoles,
and obtained evidence satisfactory to himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>that the Spanish officials at Pensacola were in
sympathy with them, resolved to march upon
that town, and repeat the lesson which he had
taught it in 1814. Before following him in
that expedition, however, mention will be made
of the adventures, fate and daughter of Francis,
the Indian prophet, who left Pensacola, it will
be remembered, with Nicholls on the approach
of the Americans in 1814.</p>

<p class='c013'>Francis had been one of Tecumseh’s most
notable and zealous disciples, as well as one of
the most sedulous in making Red Stick converts.
A leader in the massacre of Fort Mims, he had
revelled in deeds of blood in that human
slaughter pen. When Nicholls left Florida with
his troops, Francis accompanied him, and
finally made his way to London. There in a
gorgeous dress he was presented to the Prince
Regent, who in recognition of his military services
to the crown, bestowed upon him a gilded
tomahawk, with a dazzling belt, a gold snuffbox,
and a commission of brigadier-general in
the British service. Well would it have been
for the prophet had he remained in a land where
his deeds were so highly appreciated. But the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>instinct of the savage brought him back to
Florida, where he was captured by the decoy of
an American vessel lying in the St. Marks river,
flying a British flag. He went off to her in a
canoe, to meet allies, but found enemies, who
seized and delivered him to Jackson. He was
summarily hanged, with his brigadier’s commission
on his person.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a pleasing change to turn from deeds of
blood to instances of humanity, especially when
they come to us in the form of attractive youth.
A young Georgian, named Duncan McRimmon,
captured by the Indians whilst he was
fishing, was doomed to death. The stake was
fixed, the victim bound, the faggots and torch
were ready when a deliverer came in the person
of Milly or Malee, a girl of sixteen years, the
daughter of Francis. Her intercessions induced
her father to spare McRimmon and send him to
St. Marks to insure his safety. Not thinking
himself secure there, McRimmon went aboard
the decoy vessel, and by a singular fatality was
there when Francis also came.</p>

<p class='c013'>Malee, bewitching in face, slender and graceful
in form, a Red Stick in blood and courage, an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>expert with the rifle, a fearless rider who
required no other help than one of her small
hands to mount, was the ideal of an Indian
heroine. She was likewise sprightly in mind,
and spoke English and Spanish as well as
Indian.</p>

<p class='c013'>An adventure will illustrate her heroic nature.
After her father’s capture, but in ignorance of
it, she and several attendants barely escaped
the snare into which he had fallen. As they approached
the decoy, however, something occurring
to excite suspicion, their canoe was turned
for the land. To arrest it, a blank shot was
fired by the vessel. That being unheeded, a charge
of grape shot was sent after the fugitives. The
missiles fell around them, but the canoe neither
pausing nor changing its course, was paddled
the faster for the shore. A boat was sent in pursuit,
but the chase was too late. As the heroine
leaped from the canoe to the beach, she snatched
a rifle from an attendant and fired at the
pursuers. The ball having grazed several of
them, and struck the rudder-post, put an end to
the chase.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the close of the war, McRimmon sought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Malee in marriage. His suit, after repeated refusals,
was crowned with success. A marriage,
and a happy plantation home on the Suwanee,
were the fruits of her humanity, and his persistent
wooing. After eighteen years of married
life, Malee found herself a widow with eight
children.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the Red Sticks, who after the disastrous
battle of the Horse Shoe fled to the Seminole
nation, were a Creek mother and her
orphan boy, whose age might be twelve. The
young Red Stick was destined in after years to
fill the continent with his name. Osceola was
old enough at the time of Tecumseh’s mission,
and the stirring events in which it resulted, to
receive from them a deep and lasting impression.
To those impressions, doubtless, and the
blood he derived from one of those Spartan warriors,
whose heroism excited the admiration of
their conquerors,<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c014'><sup>[63]</sup></a> was due his primacy in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Seminole war; for an alien he was without the
influence of a sept to achieve it. In the career
of the Seminole chief may be discerned the far-reaching
influence of the Great Shawnee, and
the abiding force of youthful impressions.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Jackson’s Invasion of West Florida in 1818—Masot’s Protest—Capture
of Pensacola—Capitulation of San
Carlos—Provisional Government Established by Jackson—Pensacola
Restored to Spain—Governor Callava—Treaty
of Cession—Congressional Criticism of Jackson’s
Conduct.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hitherto Jackson’s operations had been confined
to the province of East Florida. On the
tenth of May, 1818, he began his invasion of
West Florida by crossing the Appalachicola
river at the Indian village of Ochesee. Thence
he followed a trail which led him over the
natural bridge of the Chipola river—a bridge
which it would be difficult for the wayfarer to
observe, as it is formed by the stream quietly
sinking into a lime-stone cavern, through which
it again emerges within a distance of half a mile.</p>

<p class='c013'>Within a few hundred yards of the trail, and
near the north side of the bridge, there is a cave
one-fourth of a mile in length, with many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>lateral grottoes, its roof pendant with glittering
stalactites and its floor covered with lime-stones
moulded in varied and eccentric forms. Panic-stricken
by Jackson’s campaign in East Florida,
the Indians on the west of the Appalachicola
river, when he began his westward march,
made this cave a place of refuge, and were there
quietly concealed when his troops unconsciously
marched over their subterranean retreat.</p>

<p class='c013'>The army marched in two divisions. The one
commanded by Jackson in person followed the
bridge trail, the other moved by a trail which
led to the river, northward of the place where
it made its cavernous descent. The water
being high, the construction of a bridge or rafts
became necessary to enable the wagons and
artillery to cross. Whilst the northern division
was thus obstructed, General Jackson, unimpeded
in his march, reached the appointed place
of junction. Here he waited, in hourly expectation
of the appearance of the other column,
until worked up to a frenzy of impatience which
was changed to indignation when, after the junction,
the interposition of a river—contradicted,
as he supposed, by his own immediate experience—was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>assigned as the cause of the delay.
At length, however, the guides, by disclosing the
existence of the bridge, solved the riddle and restored
the general to good humor.</p>

<p class='c013'>His march westward, and south of the northern
boundary of the province of West Florida,
brought him to the Escambia river, which,
having crossed, he reached the road that he
had opened over the old trail in 1814, when he
marched to Pensacola on a similar mission to
that in which he was now engaged.</p>

<p class='c013'>Don José Masot, who was governor of West
Florida, having received intelligence of Jackson’s
westward march and his designs on Pensacola,
sent him a written protest against his invasion,
as an offence against the Spanish king, “exhorting
and requiring him to retire from the
Province,” threatening if he did not, to use force
for his expulsion. This protest was delivered
by a Spanish officer, on May 23, after Jackson
had crossed the Escambia river and was within
a few hours’ march of Pensacola. Notwithstanding
Masot’s threat, instead of advancing
to meet the invader, he hastily retired with
most of his troops to Fort San Carlos, leaving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>a few only at Pensacola, under the command of
Lieutenant-colonel Don Lui Piemas, for the purpose
of making a show of resistance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Masot’s protest, instead of retarding, seems
to have accelerated Jackson’s advance. In the
afternoon of the same day on which it was received,
the American army was in possession of
Fort St. Michael and encamped around it.
Thence, immediately upon its occupation, Jackson
sent Masot a dispatch in reply to his protest,
in which he demanded an immediate
surrender of Pensacola and Barrancas. In his
answer, on May 24, to that demand, Masot,
as to Pensacola, referred Jackson to Don Lui
Piemas; as to San Carlos he replied: “This
fortress I am resolved to defend to the last extremity.
I shall repel force by force, and he
who resists aggression can never be considered
an aggressor. God preserve your excellency
many years.” Upon the receipt of this communication,
Jackson, by arrangement with
Colonel Piemas, took possession of Pensacola.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the twenty-fifth, Jackson replied to
Masot’s dispatch of the twenty-fourth, in which
he tells him he is aware of the Spanish force,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>and hints at the folly of resistance to an overwhelming
enemy. In conclusion he says: “I
applaud your feelings as a soldier in wishing to
defend your post, but when resistance is ineffectual
and the opposing force overwhelming, the
sacrifice of a few brave men is an act of wantonness,
for which the commanding officer is accountable
to his God.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In the evening of the day on which Jackson’s
communication was written, and within a few
hours after it was received by Masot, Fort
San Carlos was invested by the American army.
On the night of the twenty-fifth, batteries were
established in favorable positions within three
hundred and eighty-five yards of the fort,
though the work was interrupted by the Spanish
guns. Before the American batteries replied,
Jackson, in his anxiety to spare the effusion of
blood, sent Masot, under a flag of truce, another
demand to surrender, accompanied by a representation
of the futility, if not the folly, of
further resistance. The refusal of the demand
was followed by the batteries and the fort
opening upon each other. The firing continued
until evening, when a flag from the fort invited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>a parley, which resulted in a truce until the following
day, the twenty-seventh, when, at eight
o’clock in the morning, articles of capitulation
were signed. Such was Masot’s defense to “the
last extremity,” and such the fruit of Jackson’s
expostulation with his fiery but feeble antagonist.</p>

<p class='c013'>The military features of the capitulation were
that the Spanish surrender should be made
with the honors of war, drums beating, and
flags flying, during the march from the gate
of the fort to the foot of the glacis, where
the arms were to be stacked; the garrison
to be transported to Havana; and their rights
of property, to the last article, strictly
respected.</p>

<p class='c013'>But, as in the case of General Campbell’s and
Governor Chester’s surrender, in 1781, to Galvez,
there was a political aspect to the capitulation
of Masot.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Jackson’s despatch to Calhoun, Secretary
of war, he says of the capitulation: “The
articles, with but one condition, amount to a
complete cession to the United States, of that
portion of the Floridas hitherto under the government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>of Don José Masot.” The condition
alluded to was, that the province should be
held by the United States until Spain could furnish
a sufficient military force to execute the
obligations of existing treaties.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having accepted the cession of West-Florida
to the United States, Jackson further assumed
the authority of constituting a provisional
government for the conquered province. He
appointed one of his officers, Colonel King, civil
and military governor; he extended the revenue
laws of the United States over the country; appointed
another of his officers, Captain Gadsden,
collector of the port of Pensacola, with
authority to enforce those laws; declared what
civil laws should be enforced, and provided for
the preservation of the archives, as well as for
the care and protection of what had been the
property of the Spanish crown, but now, in the
General’s conception, become the property of
the United States.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly after these occurrences, General Jackson,
with his constitution sorely tried by the
fatigue and privations of the campaign, left
Pensacola for his home in Tennessee, to find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>quietude and repose, made sweet by public applause
on the one side, and interrupted by bitter
censure and criticism on the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>The views with which Jackson began the
Seminole campaign in March, and those which
he entertained at its close in May, by the capitulation
of Masot, present a strange and striking
contrast. He invaded East-Florida to
crush the Seminoles, as he had crushed the
Creeks of Alabama. This he accomplished by
invading the territory of a power at peace with
the United States. As an imperious necessity,
the invasion was justified by his government.
During his operations, however, he acquired information
from which he concluded that there
existed a sympathy between the Spanish
officials at Pensacola and the Indians. Ostensibly,
to correct that abuse he marched to Pensacola,
where he ended his campaign by procuring
the cession of the province of West-Florida,
followed by the establishment of an American
government, without the authority of the
United States.</p>

<p class='c013'>The United States, without formally disavowing
Jackson’s conduct, signified its readiness to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>restore Pensacola and St. Marks whenever a
Spanish force presented itself to receive the surrender.
In September, 1819, such a force appearing
at Pensacola, the town and Barrancas
were immediately evacuated by the American
troops. And thus ended the government established
by Jackson, after it had existed fourteen
months, during which it was administered
to the satisfaction of the inhabitants of the
Province.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the troops there came as governor Don
José Maria Callava, knight of the military order
of Hermenegildo, who, in 1811, had won the cross
of distinction for gallant conduct in the battle
of Almonacid, one of the many fiercely fought
battles of the Peninsula war.</p>

<p class='c013'>The advent of the Spaniards seemed to be inconsistent
with the fact that, on the twenty-second
of the previous February, a treaty had
been entered into between Secretary Adams and
Don Louis de Onis, the Spanish minister for the
cession of the Floridas. But it was subject to
the ratification of both governments, and,
though ratified by the United States, it had not
been acted upon by Spain. At first the re-occupation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>might have been considered a matter of
form, in which a sensitive government consulted
its dignity by placing itself in a condition to
make a voluntary surrender of territory for a
consideration, instead of appearing to submit to
a conquest. But, as time rolled on without a
ratification of the treaty by Spain, the re-occupation
of Pensacola seemed to point to her
determination to permanently retain the
Floridas.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was believed, at the time the treaty was
negotiated, that Jackson’s bold action had done
more to bring it about than Mr. Adams’ diplomatic
skill, a belief for which there was an
apparent foundation in the delay of Spain to
ratify it after the pressure of his conquest was
removed.</p>

<p class='c013'>No instance in the life of that great man more
strikingly illustrates than these transactions
the beneficent working of that imperious will,
to which he made everything bend that stood
in the way to the attainment of what he conceived
a patriotic end.</p>

<p class='c013'>The necessity for the campaign of 1814, as
well as that which he had just closed, convinced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>him that Florida, as a Spanish colony, would
be a constant menace to the peace and security
of the border settlements of Alabama and
Georgia, not so much from the hostility of the
Spanish as their inability to control the restless
and war-like Seminoles. He saw, too, the
necessity of making Spain sensible of her obligation
to exercise the necessary restraint upon
her savage subjects, and at the same time to
make her fully realize the large and onerous
military establishment it would be necessary to
maintain in Florida to accomplish that object.
The articles of capitulation brought the United
States and Spain face to face upon this question.
It impressed upon the former the imperative
necessity of securing a permanent cession, and
it compelled the latter to count the cost involved
in fulfilling the condition by which only
the provisional cession could be nullified.</p>

<p class='c013'>A study of the correspondence between Masot
and Jackson, whilst the latter was still east of
the Appalachicola river, creates the impression
that the reason assigned by Jackson for his expedition
to Pensacola was but a pretext, and
that the real motive was made manifest by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>articles of capitulation—a provisional cession,
as the first step to a permanent cession. He
was unsustained by his government openly, at
least, he was censured by a congressional committee
and denounced by the press, but he soon
found his vindication in public opinion, enlightened
by subsequent events.</p>

<p class='c013'>Masot, the other chief actor in these transactions,
had been appointed governor of West
Florida in November, 1816, and, as we have
seen, his official term ended with the capitulation
of the twenty-seventh of May, 1818.
Shortly afterwards he left Pensacola for Havana
in the cartel <i>Peggy</i>, one of the vessels provided
by Jackson to carry the Spanish governor to
the latter place. The <i>Peggy</i> was overhauled by
an armed vessel under the “Independent Flag,”
as the ensign of Spain’s revolted South American
colonies was called. No lives were taken,
nor was the <i>Peggy</i> made a prize, for she was an
American, but the Spaniards were robbed.
Masot had with him eight thousand dollars in
coin, which he had concealed. A slight suspension
by the neck, however, as a hint of a higher
and more fatal one, wrung from him the hiding-place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>of his treasure, which he lost, but saved
his life.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c014'><sup>[64]</sup></a> The <i>Peggy</i> was overhauled by the
“Independent Flag,” during a voyage to
Havana from Campeachy, whither she had
taken refuge from what was supposed to be a
piratical vessel.</p>

<p class='c013'>During Masot’s administration there occurred
a transaction which occupied a place in the investigations
of the special committee of the
senate of the United States, appointed, in 1818,
to inquire into and report upon the occurrences
of the Seminole war of that year, prominent
amongst them the capture of St. Marks and
Pensacola. The committee condemned all Jackson’s
proceedings and seem to have even
harbored the suspicion that a land speculation
prompted him to exact a cession of the latter
place. The circumstances which induced the
suspicion are detailed in an affidavit of General
John B. Eaton, afterwards secretary of war
under Jackson and governor of Florida, which
appears amongst the documents accompanying
the report of the committee.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c014'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>It seems that, in 1817, Eaton and James
Jackson of Nashville—nowise related to General
Jackson—foreseeing that Florida was to be acquired
by the United States, resolved to make a
purchase of lots in Pensacola and lands in its
vicinity. To them were afterwards added six
associates, John McCrae, James Jackson, Jr.,
John C. McElmore, John Jackson, Thomas
Childress and John Donelson, who was a nephew
of Mrs. Jackson. Donelson and a Mr. Gordon
were appointed to proceed to Pensacola to
make the purchases. As a measure of security
to Donelson and Gordon, Eaton applied to
General Jackson and obtained for them a letter
of introduction to Masot. Provided with this
letter, which facilitated their operations, Donelson
and Gordon went to Pensacola and fulfilled
their mission by buying a large number of unimproved
town lots, sixty acres of land adjoining
the town and a tract on the bay two or
three miles to the westward.</p>

<p class='c013'>Eaton says: General Jackson had no interest
in the speculation, nor was he consulted respecting
it, his only connection with it being the
letter to Masot. As there is no allusion to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>transaction in the report of the committee, they
must have concluded that the suspicion which
prompted the search for evidence respecting it
was unfounded. Such at least must be the just
conclusion from the silence in respect to the
matter observed by a document so full of
pointed condemnation of Jackson’s acts, of the
manner in which his army was raised and the
officers commissioned by himself, the executions
of Arbuthnot and Ambrister, the capture of St.
Marks and Pensacola, the establishment of a
provisional government, the extension of the
revenue laws of the United States over the
conquered province, and the appointments for it
of a governor and a collector of the customs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Treaty Ratified—Jackson Appointed Provisional Governor—Goes
to Pensacola—Mrs. Jackson in Pensacola—Change
of Flags—Callava Imprisoned—Territorial Government—Governor
Duval—First Legislature Meets at
Pensacola.</p>

<p class='c012'>Although the United States was unremitting
in its efforts to induce Spain to ratify the
treaty of cession, her ratification was postponed
from time to time under various pretexts.
Prominent English journals having declared,
that if Florida was ceded to the United
States, Great Britain, in order to maintain her
influence in the Gulf of Mexico, should insist
upon a surrender to her of the Island of Cuba,
public opinion in the United States settled
down to the conclusion that the delay of the
ratification was due to British intrigue. But,
that this opinion was ill founded, is evident
from President Monroe’s message of the seventh
of December, 1819, in which he says: “In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>course which the Spanish government has on
this occasion thought proper to pursue, it is
satisfactory to know that they have not been
countenanced by any European power. On the
contrary, the opinion and wishes of both France
and Great Britain have not been withheld
either from the United States or Spain, and
have been unequivocal in favor of ratification.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The procrastination of Spain was the occasion
of intense public feeling in the United
States; which at length formally manifested
itself on March 8, 1820, in a resolution reported
by the committee of Foreign Relations of the
House of Representatives, to authorize the President
to take possession of West Florida.
Patience, however, prevailed, and on February
19, 1821, the ratification took place.</p>

<p class='c013'>General Jackson was shortly afterwards appointed
Provisional Governor of Florida, and
instructed to proceed to Pensacola with a
small military force, to receive from the Spanish
authorities a formal surrender of West Florida.
On April 18, he left the Hermitage, with Mrs.
Jackson and his adopted son, Andrew Jackson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Donelson, to enter upon the long, tedious journey
to Pensacola, via New Orleans.</p>

<p class='c013'>A stage of the journey in Southern Alabama,
brought him to a military post, in the neighborhood
of which, William Weatherford, the Creek
hero, resided. At the suggestion of General
Jackson, Colonel Brooke, the commandant of
the Post, and his host, invited Weatherford to
dine with his conqueror. The invitation was
accepted. When the Great Chief appeared,
Jackson cordially met him, and taking him by
the hand, presented him to Mrs. Jackson as
“the bravest man in his tribe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Coming into Florida early in July, on reaching
what was then known as the Fifteen Mile
House, now as Gonzalia, where Mr. Manuel
Gonzalez then had his cattle ranch, the General
spent several days with him. Whilst there,
hearing of the approach of his troops, accompanied
by Mr. Gonzalez, he went up the road
to meet them. Coming to a creek, they saw
the wagons of several up-country traders stuck
in the mud, which the latter, for lack of sufficient
force, were making ineffectual attempts
to move. On the other side of the branch were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>several men lying on the ground, and horses
grazing near them. Accosting the men who
were tugging at the wheels of a wagon, Jackson
said, “Why don’t you get those men across the
branch to help you?” “Oh! they say they are
General Jackson’s staff.” “Well,” said he, “I
am General Jackson himself, and by the eternal,
I will help you!” And with those words, dismounting
from his horse, and throwing off his
coat, he lustily put his shoulder to the wheel.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon the arrival of the troops at the Fifteen
Mile House, headquarters were established, and
remained there until all the arrangements were
made for a formal change of government.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Jackson, however, took up her residence
at Pensacola two or three weeks before July 17,
when the change of flags was to take place.
During the Sundays which preceded the change,
Mrs. Jackson, who was an eminently pious
woman, cherishing great reverence for the Sabbath,
was greatly scandalized by the manner
in which it was dishonored. Shops did more
business on that day than any other. It was a
day of public gambling, fiddling, dancing, and
boisterous conduct. When the last Sunday of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Spanish rule came, seemingly because the last,
the fiddling, dancing, noise and confusion, exceeded
that of any preceding one. Unable to
restrain her pious indignation, Mrs. Jackson
vented it in a protest against the Sabattic Saturnalia,
made through Major Staunton, with the
emphatic announcement that the next Sunday
should be differently spent.</p>

<p class='c013'>In anticipation of the change of government,
there was a large influx of people from the
States, induced by the great expectations entertained
of the future of Pensacola; a future in
which it was confidently predicted, it was to be
the rival of New Orleans. Many persons also
came expecting official appointments from the
new Governor, but who, greatly to his chagrin,
as we learn from Mrs. Jackson’s letters, were disappointed,
in consequence of the President himself
making the appointments.</p>

<p class='c013'>At length the sun arose upon the day when
its beams were for the last time to bathe in
light the ancient banner of Castile and Aragon,
as the emblem of the sovereignty of these
shores. In the early morning appeared in the
Public Square the Spanish Governor’s guards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>handsomely dressed and equipped, consisting
of a full company of dismounted dragoons of
the regiment of Tarragona. After a parade,
they fell into line south of the flag staff, extending
from east to west in front of the Government
House, which stood on the north-east corner
of Jefferson and Sargossa streets. At eight
o’clock there marched down Palafox street a
battalion of the Fourth Infantry, and a company
of the Fourth United States Artillery,
coming from their camp at Galvez Springs, which
filing into the Square, formed a line opposite the
Spanish guards, and north of the flag staff.
Precisely at ten o’clock, General Jackson and
his staff, entering the Square, passed amid
salutes from the Spanish and American troops,
between their lines to the Government House,
where Governor Callava awaited him for the
purpose of executing the documentary formalities
of the cession. As the first sign that this
act was performed, the Spanish sergeant guard
at the gate was relieved by an American sentinel.
General Jackson and Governor Callava
then left the house, and passed between the
double line of troops. As they reached the flag
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>staff the Spanish flag came down, and the stars
and stripes went up, saluted by the Fourth Artillery
and the sloop-of-war <i>Hornet</i>, whilst her
band, assisting at the ceremony, played the
Star Spangled Banner.</p>

<p class='c013'>At Barrancas the ceremony was slightly
different. The flags of both nations appeared
at the same time at half-mast. In that position
they were saluted by the Spaniards. As
the flags were separated, one ascending and the
other descending, both were honored with a
salute by the Americans.</p>

<p class='c013'>The day was naturally one of rejoicing to the
Americans, but as naturally one of sadness
and in some instances of heart aches to the
Spanish population. The advantages of being
under the United States government were too
great not to be appreciated by owners of real
estate and business men generally. But there
was a sentimental side to the change. Some of
the Spanish garrison had married in Pensacola,
and with others the inhabitants had formed
social ties, induced by a common language,
habits and tastes. To them it can well be imagined
that the change of flags was but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>presage of bitter separations. In 1763 all
the Spanish left the country, and in a common
exile mutual consolation was found; but, in
1821, the sorrow was that a part went and a
part remained to mingle with a strange people.
Mrs. Jackson, in a letter, thus expresses the
emotions of the occasion: “Oh! how they
burst into tears to see the last ray of hope depart
from their devoted city and country—delivering
up the keys of the archives—the vessels
lying in the harbor in full view to waft them to
their distant port.... How did the city sit
solitary and mourn. Never did my heart feel
more for a people. Being present, I entered
immediately into their feelings.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The Sunday following the change was, according
to Mrs. Jackson’s prediction, one of
quietude and freedom from the license of
previous ones, which had so shocked her
religious sensibilities. She thus expresses the
change: “Yesterday I had the happiness of
witnessing the truth of what I had said. Great
order was observed, the doors kept shut, the
gambling houses demolished, fiddling and dancing
not heard any more on the Lord’s day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>cursing not to be heard.” For the change the
lovers of Sunday quietude were doubtless
indebted to Mrs. Jackson, for her prediction is
not to be taken as that of a prophetess who
merely foresees and foretells, but that of a
woman with a will of her own, and conscious
of her ability to direct the stern governor in
the exercise of his authority, at least outside of
politics.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next morning after the change of flags,
the Spanish officers and garrison sailed for
Havana in the transports <i>Anne Maria</i> and
<i>Tom Shields</i>, under convoy of the United States
sloop-of-war <i>Hornet</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Governor Callava and staff, however, remained
in Pensacola, where his handsome
person, polished manners, soldierly bearing and
high character made him a general favorite with
the American officers and their families, who
extended to him every social courtesy. General
and Mrs. Jackson, however, were distant and
reserved in their bearing towards him, resulting
in some measure from a prejudice against Spanish
officials induced by the general’s experience
with Maurique and Masot. Perhaps, too, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>mingled with that prejudice a slight feeling of
jealousy of Callava’s social success, a weakness
from which strong characters, under the insinuation
of others, are not exempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>There soon occurred, however, a painful interruption
of the gallant Spaniard’s social enjoyment—so
graceful an attendant of the change
of government—by an occurrence which must
be regarded as a lasting reproach to its authors.</p>

<p class='c013'>The treaty required the Spanish government
to surrender all documents relating to private
rights in the archives of the province. This
duty had been performed by Callava, who had
caused a separation to be made between the
documents falling within the definition of the
treaty and others which did not, and had delivered
the former to Alcalde H. M. Brackenridge,
an appointee of the American governor. The
latter papers, packed in boxes for transportation
to Havana, were placed in the custody of
<a id='e6'></a>Domingo Sousa, one of Callava’s subordinates.
In the separation of the papers, one relating to
the estate of Nicholas Maria Vidal, involving a
trifling sum, was by accident placed with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>documents in one of the boxes in Sousa’s possession.</p>

<p class='c013'>A woman claiming to be an heir of Vidal complained
to Brackenridge that the paper had not
been delivered to him and was about to be
removed to Havana by Sousa. Brackenridge,
instead of politely calling Callava’s attention
to the woman’s complaint and asking for a surrender
of the document, at once made a preemptory
demand for it upon Sousa. Sousa
properly declined compliance, alleging his want
of authority to do so without instructions
from Callava, and at the same time, to relieve
himself from responsibility in the matter, sent
the boxes to Callava’s house. Brackenridge at
once reported the matter to Jackson, who
ordered Sousa to be imprisoned, and at the same
time Callava to be arrested and brought before
him immediately, although it was night and
Callava was at the time at a dinner party at Colonel
Brooke’s. When the knightly Castilian was
brought before Jackson, he naturally proposed
to enter a protest against such astonishing
proceedings. This Jackson would not permit,
but insisted that Callava should at once answer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>interrogatories to be propounded to him. Callava’s
persistent attempts to protest were as
persistently interrupted by Jackson, until at
last the latter, in a rage of passion, ordered him
to be imprisoned, an order which was promptly
executed by committing him to the calaboose,
where Sousa had preceded him. This outrage
committed, Alcalde Brackenridge, as if determined
to leave no bounds of decency unviolated,
had the boxes at Callava’s house opened that
night and took from one of them the worthless
paper—worthless at least to the claimant—that
had occasioned the trouble.</p>

<p class='c013'>For this disgraceful transaction Brackenridge
is primarily responsible. He was an intelligent
lawyer, afterwards a judge, and later a member
of Congress from Pennsylvania; and therefore,
presumably acquainted with the decencies, to
say nothing of the amenities of official intercourse.
He was likewise well acquainted with
Jackson’s prejudices and irascible temper, as
well as what a fire-brand to his nature were the
wrongs, whether real or simulated, of a woman.
In the light of these considerations, Brackenridge
must stand condemned, as either a wilful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>mischief-maker, or a wily sycophant, playing
from selfish motives, upon the weaknesses of a
great man.</p>

<p class='c013'>But neither Jackson’s greatness, nor his being
the dupe of Brackenridge, can remove from him
the reproach of having in this transaction violated
official courtesy, the chivalrous consideration
due by one distinguished soldier to
another, as well as the laws of international
comity and hospitality.</p>

<p class='c013'>A writ of Habeas Corpus was issued by Hon.
Elijias Fromentin, U. S. Judge for West Florida,
to bring before him Callava and Sousa, on the
night they were committed. Obedience to the
writ was refused by the guard, who sent it to
the Governor. Thereupon, His Excellency issued
a notice to the Judge to appear before him, “to
show cause why he has attempted to interfere
with my authority as Governor of the Floridas,
exercising the powers of the Captain-General
and Intendant of the Island of Cuba.” The
Judge prudently delayed his appearance until
the next day, in order to allow the Governor
time to cool; but in the meantime remained in
momentary expectation of a guard to take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>him to jail. The affair, however, ended in a
stormy interview, in which to the Governor’s
question, whether the Judge “would dare to
issue a writ to be served on the Captain-General,”
the latter replied, “No, but if the case
should require it, I would issue one to be served
on the President of the United States.”</p>

<p class='c013'>After the troublesome paper was procured by
Brackenridge, an order was made for the release
of Callava. A few days after his release he left
Pensacola for Washington to make his complaints
to the United States government.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of the Spanish officers whom he had left
in Pensacola, published after his departure, a
paper expressing their sense of the outrage to
which he had been subjected. This being regarded
by Jackson as an attempt “to disturb the
harmony, peace and good order of the existing
government of the Floridas,” the protesting
Spaniards were by proclamation ordered to
leave the country by the third of October, allowing
them four days for preparation, “on pain of
being dealt with according to law, for contempt
and disobedience of this, my proclamation.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A tragedy occurred during Jackson’s rule,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>which illustrates his lack of tenderness of
human life. With full knowledge of the affair,
he permitted a duel to be fought in a public
place by two young officers, Hull and Randall.
When he was informed that the former had
fallen, shot through the heart, pistol in hand,
with the trigger at half-cock, he angrily exclaimed: “Damn
the pistol; by G—d, to think
that a brave man should risk his life on a hair-trigger!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jackson’s bearing generally, and especially
his summary dealings with Callava and Sousa,
had inspired the population with great fear of
his despotic temper. Of that feeling there occurred
a ludicrous illustration. An alarm of
fire brought a crowd to the Public Square,
which was near the fire. General Jackson also
hurried to the scene. To stir the lookers-on to
exertion, he made a yelling appeal. The crowd
not understanding English, and thinking it
had heard a notice to disperse, took to its heels,
and left the General the sole occupant of the
Square.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Jackson was a domestic woman, and
better satisfied to have her husband at home,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>than to see him in exalted stations requiring
his absence from the Hermitage. Whilst in
Pensacola, she pined for that dear spot; and it
is, evidently, with joy, that she announced in a
letter to a friend, that the General calls his
coming to Florida, “a wild goose chase,” and
that he proposed an early return. In October
they returned to Tennessee.</p>

<p class='c013'>That a man of his estate and political prospects,
should have accepted, to fill for a few
months, the office of Governor of a wilderness,
with a salary of $5,000, admits of only one explanation.
His recent campaign had been so
severely condemned, that he regarded the tender
of the appointment by Mr. Monroe, as having
the semblance, at least, of a national apology
for the injustice which he had suffered, and
accordingly he accepted it in the spirit in which
it was tendered. In a word, he filled the office,
because filling it would be a vindication of his
conduct in the campaign of 1818.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the third of March, 1822, congress
established a territorial government for both
the Floridas as one territory. The first governor
under the territorial organization was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>W. P. Duval of Kentucky, who had represented
a district of that state in congress, and who
was the original of Washington Irving’s Ralph
Ringwood. He resided, temporarily, in Pensacola,
where the legislative council of thirteen,
appointed by the President, held its first session.
It had hardly begun its work, however, when
the yellow fever breaking out compelled an adjournment
to the Fifteen-mile house, before
mentioned, where the Florida statutes of 1822
were enacted. One of them illustrates the vice
or virtue there may be in a name. The title of
“An Act for the Benefit of Insolvent Debtors,”
was misprinted in the laws of the session so as
to read: “An Act for the Relief of Insolent
Debtors.” The error destroyed its utility, and
no man, it is said, as long as it remained on the
statute book, ever invoked the relief of its provisions.</p>

<p class='c013'>The limit assigned to these historical sketches
has now been reached. The space that intervenes
between the visit of the luckless Narvaez
to Pensacola bay and the establishment of the
territorial government of Florida embraces a
period of nearly three hundred years. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>changes and shifting scenes which, during that
period, marked the history of the settlements on
its shores, stand in contrast with the persistency
of the arbitrary boundary line of the Perdido,
established by the mutual consent of the Spanish
and French in the early years of the eighteenth
century. Disturbed by the English dominion
for twenty years, it was restored by the Spanish,
and finally confirmed in 1822 by the act of
congress establishing a territorial government
for the Floridas.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1820 the constitutional convention of
Alabama, in anticipation of the ratification of
the Spanish treaty, memorialized congress to
embrace West Florida within the boundaries of
that state. The memorial enforced the measure
with all those obvious arguments which come
to the mind when it turns to the subject. But
they were silenced, as if by the imperious decree
of fate that the Perdido boundary should be,
and forever remain, a monument of d’ Arriola’s
diligence in reaching the Gulf coast three years
before d’ Iberville.</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. “On the sixth of February 1780, at night, a fearful storm
arose with repeated thunder and lightning. An earthquake
was accompanied by such a violent shock, that in
the barracks the regimentals and the arm racks fell from
the walls in a great many places, and everything was
moved in the rooms. The doors were sprung, chimneys
were thrown together, and from the fires burning on the
hearths, a conflagration threatened to burst forth.
Neighboring houses clashed together, and those buried in
the ruins cried for help. The sea foamed and raged; the
thunder continually rolled. It was a terrible night. Only
towards one o’clock, the raging elements in some measure
again became subdued. Wonderful to relate, no human
life was lost.”—Von Elking, Vol. II, p. 144.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. It is to the presence of these Waldecks at the siege and
capture of Pensacola, that we are indebted for the only detailed
account we possess of those events. The Waldeck
regiment was one of the many mercenary bodies of German
troops which Great Britain hired to conquer her revolted
colonies. On the return of the commands to Germany,
after the close of the war, each commander was required to
make to his government a detailed report of its experiences.
In 1863, Max Von Elking published, at Hanover, two volumes
containing the substance of those reports, entitled:</p>

<p class='c013'>[“Die deutschen Hülfstruppen im Nordamerikanischen
Befreiungskriege, 1776 bis 1783.”]</p>

<p class='c013'>The German Troops in the North American War of Independence,
1776 to 1783.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those of the Waldecks extended from the day the regiment
was completed at Corbach, where it was reviewed by
the widowed Princess of Waldeck, and her court ladies,
on May 9, 1776, up to the return of its small remnant
in 1783. The princess entertained them, and furnished
them besides 100 guelden for a jollification—doubtless out
of the hire she received for the hapless creatures. The remark
of a courtier, that he would see “all those who came
back riding in carriages,” indicates the delusive hopes with
which it was sought to inspire them. Nevertheless, it was
thought prudent by the Princess, that the departing mercenaries
should, to prevent desertion, be guarded during
their journey to the <i>Weser</i>, where they were to embark, by
the Green Regiment of Sharpshooters. The regiment consisted
of 640 men, under the command of Colonel Von
Hanxleden. Stuernagel was the Field Preacher, or chaplain,
to whose <a id='e3'></a>journal Von Elking makes many references.</p>

“General Jackson, I am not afraid of you. I fear no man,

behalf of myself; you can kill me if you wish. I come to beg
you to send for the women and children of the war party

have been destroyed by your people, who have driven them
to the woods without one ear of corn. I hope you will send
out parties to safely bring them here in order that they
may be fed. I exerted myself in vain to prevent the massacre
of the women and children at Fort Mims. I am now done
fighting. The Red Sticks are nearly all killed. If I could

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
